P. Lovecraft\\n\\n\\n\\n(Found Among the Papers of the LateFrancis Wayland Thurston, of Boston)\\n“Of such great powers or beings there may be conceivably a survival\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\r\\na survival of a hugely remote period when\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. consciousness was manifested,\\r\\nperhaps, in shapes and forms long since withdrawn before the tide of advancing humanity\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\r\\nforms of which poetry and legend alone have caught a flying memory and called them gods, monsters,\\r\\nmythical beings of all sorts and kinds.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.”\\n—Algernon Blackwood.\\nI.The Horror in Clay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate\\r\\nall its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity,\\r\\nand it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction,\\r\\nhave hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will\\r\\nopen up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall\\r\\neither go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of\\r\\na new dark age.\\nTheosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein\\r\\nour world and human race form transient incidents. They have hinted at strange survivals in\\r\\nterms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism. But it is not from them\\r\\nthat there came the single glimpse of forbidden aeons which chills me when I think of it and\\r\\nmaddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse, like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed out from\\r\\nan accidental piecing together of separated things—in this case an old newspaper item\\r\\nand the notes of a dead professor. I hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out;\\r\\ncertainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain. I think that\\r\\nthe professor, too, intended to keep silent regarding the part he knew, and that he would have\\r\\ndestroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him.\\nMy knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926–27 with the death\\r\\nof my grand-uncle George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brown University,\\r\\nProvidence, Rhode Island. Professor Angell was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions,\\r\\nand had frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums; so that his passing at\\r\\nthe age of ninety-two may be recalled by many. Locally, interest was intensified by the obscurity\\r\\nof the cause of death. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the Newport boat;\\r\\nfalling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical-looking negro who\\r\\nhad come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short\\r\\ncut from the waterfront to the deceased’s home in Williams Street. Physicians were unable\\r\\nto find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion\\r\\nof the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible\\r\\nfor the end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but latterly I am inclined\\r\\nto wonder—and more than wonder.\\nAs my grand-uncle’s heir and executor, for he died a childless widower,\\r\\nI was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purpose moved his\\r\\nentire set of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of the material which I correlated\\r\\nwill be later published by the American Archaeological Society, but there was one box which\\r\\nI found exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much averse from shewing to other eyes. It had\\r\\nbeen locked, and I did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal ring\\r\\nwhich the professor carried always in his pocket. Then indeed I succeeded in opening it, but\\r\\nwhen I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more closely locked barrier. For\\r\\nwhat could be the meaning of the queer clay bas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings,\\r\\nand cuttings which I found? Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the most\\r\\nsuperficial impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this\\r\\napparent disturbance of an old man’s peace of mind.\\nThe bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five\\r\\nby six inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs, however, were far from modern\\r\\nin atmosphere and suggestion; for although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and\\r\\nwild, they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing.\\r\\nAnd writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be; though my memory,\\r\\ndespite much familiarity with the papers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify\\r\\nthis particular species, or even to hint at its remotest affiliations.\\nAbove these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial intent,\\r\\nthough its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. It seemed to be\\r\\na sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could\\r\\nconceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of\\r\\nan octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the\\r\\nthing. A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings;\\r\\nbut it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful.\\r\\nBehind the figure was a vague suggestion of a Cyclopean architectural background.\\nThe writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of press cuttings,\\r\\nin Professor Angell’s most recent hand; and made no pretence to literary style. What seemed\\r\\nto be the main document was headed “CTHULHU CULT” in characters painstakingly printed\\r\\nto avoid the erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of. The manuscript was divided into two\\r\\nsections, the first of which was headed “1925—Dream and Dream Work of H. A. Wilcox,\\r\\n7 Thomas St., Providence, R.I.”, and the second, “Narrative of Inspector John R.\\r\\nLegrasse, 121 Bienville St., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg.—Notes on Same, &\\r\\nProf. Webb’s Acct.” The other manuscript papers were all brief notes, some of them\\r\\naccounts of the queer dreams of different persons, some of them citations from theosophical\\r\\nbooks and magazines (notably W. Scott-Elliot’s Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria),\\r\\nand the rest comments on long-surviving secret societies and hidden cults, with references to\\r\\npassages in such mythological and anthropological source-books as Frazer’s Golden Bough\\r\\nand Miss Murray’s Witch-Cult in Western Europe. The cuttings largely alluded to\\r\\noutré mental illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925.\\nThe first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale. It appears\\r\\nthat on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon\\r\\nProfessor Angell bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and fresh.\\r\\nHis card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle had recognised him as the youngest\\r\\nson of an excellent family slightly known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at\\r\\nthe Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near that institution.\\r\\nWilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity, and had from childhood\\r\\nexcited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating.\\r\\nHe called himself “psychically hypersensitive”, but the staid folk of the ancient\\r\\ncommercial city dismissed him as merely “queer”. Never mingling much with his kind,\\r\\nhe had dropped gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a small group of\\r\\naesthetes from other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its conservatism,\\r\\nhad found him quite hopeless.\\nOn the occasion of the visit, ran the professor’s manuscript, the sculptor\\r\\nabruptly asked for the benefit of his host’s archaeological knowledge in identifying the\\r\\nhieroglyphics on the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and\\r\\nalienated sympathy; and my uncle shewed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness\\r\\nof the tablet implied kinship with anything but archaeology. Young Wilcox’s rejoinder,\\r\\nwhich impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically\\r\\npoetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since found highly\\r\\ncharacteristic of him. He said, “It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream\\r\\nof strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or\\r\\ngarden-girdled Babylon.”\\nIt was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping\\r\\nmemory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a slight earthquake tremor the\\r\\nnight before, the most considerable felt in New England for some years; and Wilcox’s imagination\\r\\nhad been keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean\\r\\ncities of titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with\\r\\nlatent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point\\r\\nbelow had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute\\r\\ninto sound, but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters,\\r\\n“Cthulhu fhtagn”.\\nThis verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed\\r\\nProfessor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; and studied with almost\\r\\nfrantic intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad\\r\\nonly in his night-clothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his\\r\\nold age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness in recognising both hieroglyphics and pictorial\\r\\ndesign. Many of his questions seemed highly out-of-place to his visitor, especially those which\\r\\ntried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand\\r\\nthe repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership\\r\\nin some widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor Angell became convinced\\r\\nthat the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his\\r\\nvisitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for after the first\\r\\ninterview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man, during which he related startling\\r\\nfragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark\\r\\nand dripping stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical\\r\\nsense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds most frequently repeated are those\\r\\nrendered by the letters “Cthulhu” and “R’lyeh”.\\nOn March 23d, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiries\\r\\nat his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to\\r\\nthe home of his family in Waterman Street. He had cried out in the night, arousing several other\\r\\nartists in the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness\\r\\nand delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close\\r\\nwatch of the case; calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to\\r\\nbe in charge. The youth’s febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things; and\\r\\nthe doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them. They included not only a repetition of\\r\\nwhat he had formerly dreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing “miles high”\\r\\nwhich walked or lumbered about. He at no time fully described this object, but occasional frantic\\r\\nwords, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the professor that it must be identical with the\\r\\nnameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this object,\\r\\nthe doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man’s subsidence into lethargy.\\r\\nHis temperature, oddly enough, was not greatly above normal; but his whole condition was otherwise\\r\\nsuch as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder.\\nOn April 2nd at about 3 p.m. every trace of Wilcox’s malady suddenly\\r\\nceased. He sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of\\r\\nwhat had happened in dream or reality since the night of March 22nd. Pronounced well by his\\r\\nphysician, he returned to his quarters in three days; but to Professor Angell he was of no further\\r\\nassistance. All traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept\\r\\nno record of his night-thoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly\\r\\nusual visions.\\nHere the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain of the\\r\\nscattered notes gave me much material for thought—so much, in fact, that only the ingrained\\r\\nscepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the artist. The\\r\\nnotes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same\\r\\nperiod as that in which young Wilcox had had his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had\\r\\nquickly instituted a prodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends\\r\\nwhom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and\\r\\nthe dates of any notable visions for some time past. The reception of his request seems to have\\r\\nbeen varied; but he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any ordinary\\r\\nman could have handled without a secretary. This original correspondence was not preserved,\\r\\nbut his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest. Average people in society and\\r\\nbusiness—New England’s traditional “salt of the earth”—gave an\\r\\nalmost completely negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions\\r\\nappear here and there, always between March 23d and April 2nd—the period of young Wilcox’s\\r\\ndelirium. Scientific men were little more affected, though four cases of vague description suggest\\r\\nfugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something\\r\\nabnormal.\\nIt was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I know\\r\\nthat panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes. As it was, lacking their\\r\\noriginal letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having\\r\\nedited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see. That is\\r\\nwhy I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed,\\r\\nhad been imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from aesthetes told a disturbing\\r\\ntale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things,\\r\\nthe intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor’s\\r\\ndelirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported scenes and half-sounds not\\r\\nunlike those which Wilcox had described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the\\r\\ngigantic nameless thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with emphasis,\\r\\nwas very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism,\\r\\nwent violently insane on the date of young Wilcox’s seizure, and expired several months\\r\\nlater after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle\\r\\nreferred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration\\r\\nand personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these,\\r\\nhowever, bore out the notes in full. I have often wondered if all the objects of the professor’s\\r\\nquestioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever\\r\\nreach them.\\nThe press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania,\\r\\nand eccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell must have employed a cutting bureau,\\r\\nfor the number of extracts was tremendous and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here\\r\\nwas a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking\\r\\ncry. Here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic\\r\\ndeduces a dire future from visions he has seen. A despatch from California describes a theosophist\\r\\ncolony as donning white robes en masse for some “glorious fulfilment” which never\\r\\narrives, whilst items from India speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of\\r\\nMarch. Voodoo orgies multiply in Hayti, and African outposts report ominous mutterings. American\\r\\nofficers in the Philippines find certain tribes bothersome about this time, and New York policemen\\r\\nare mobbed by hysterical Levantines on the night of March 22–23. The west of Ireland,\\r\\ntoo, is full of wild rumour and legendry, and a fantastic painter named Ardois-Bonnot hangs\\r\\na blasphemous “Dream Landscape” in the Paris spring salon of 1926. And so numerous\\r\\nare the recorded troubles in insane asylums, that only a miracle can have stopped the medical\\r\\nfraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions. A weird bunch\\r\\nof cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with\\r\\nwhich I set them aside. But I was then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters\\r\\nmentioned by the professor.\\nII.The Tale of Inspector Legrasse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe older matters which had made the sculptor’s dream and bas-relief so significant to\\r\\nmy uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript. Once before, it appears,\\r\\nProfessor Angell had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the\\r\\nunknown hieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as “Cthulhu”;\\r\\nand all this in so stirring and horrible a connexion that it is small wonder he pursued young\\r\\nWilcox with queries and demands for data.\\nThe earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when the American\\r\\nArchaeological Society held its annual meeting in St. Louis. Professor Angell, as befitted one\\r\\nof his authority and attainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was\\r\\none of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation\\r\\nto offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solution.\\nThe chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for\\r\\nthe entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had travelled all the way\\r\\nfrom New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source. His name\\r\\nwas John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an Inspector of Police. With him he bore\\r\\nthe subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette\\r\\nwhose origin he was at a loss to determine. It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had\\r\\nthe least interest in archaeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted\\r\\nby purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, or whatever it was, had\\r\\nbeen captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on\\r\\na supposed voodoo meeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it, that\\r\\nthe police could not but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them,\\r\\nand infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of its origin,\\r\\napart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members, absolutely\\r\\nnothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which\\r\\nmight help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain-head.\\nInspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering\\r\\ncreated. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a\\r\\nstate of tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive\\r\\nfigure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at\\r\\nunopened and archaic vistas. No recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object,\\r\\nyet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of\\r\\nunplaceable stone.\\nThe figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful\\r\\nstudy, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship.\\r\\nIt represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose\\r\\nface was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore\\r\\nfeet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural\\r\\nmalignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block\\r\\nor pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings touched the back edge\\r\\nof the block, the seat occupied the centre, whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up,\\r\\ncrouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the\\r\\nbottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facial\\r\\nfeelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher’s elevated knees.\\r\\nThe aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, and the more subtly fearful because its source\\r\\nwas so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was unmistakable; yet not one\\r\\nlink did it shew with any known type of art belonging to civilisation’s youth—or\\r\\nindeed to any other time. Totally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the\\r\\nsoapy, greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing\\r\\nfamiliar to geology or mineralogy. The characters along the base were equally baffling; and\\r\\nno member present, despite a representation of half the world’s expert learning in this\\r\\nfield, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship. They, like the\\r\\nsubject and material, belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we\\r\\nknow it; something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our\\r\\nworld and our conceptions have no part.\\nAnd yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at\\r\\nthe Inspector’s problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of\\r\\nbizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence\\r\\nof the odd trifle he knew. This person was the late William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology\\r\\nin Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note. Professor Webb had been engaged,\\r\\nforty-eight years before, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions\\r\\nwhich he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast had encountered a\\r\\nsingular tribe or cult of degenerate Esquimaux whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship,\\r\\nchilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which\\r\\nother Esquimaux knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had\\r\\ncome down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made. Besides nameless rites\\r\\nand human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder\\r\\ndevil or tornasuk; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from\\r\\nan aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew\\r\\nhow. But just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around\\r\\nwhich they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the professor stated,\\r\\na very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing. And\\r\\nso far as he could tell, it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing\\r\\nnow lying before the meeting.\\nThis data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members,\\r\\nproved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at once to ply his informant with\\r\\nquestions. Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp cult-worshippers his men had\\r\\narrested, he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst\\r\\nthe diabolist Esquimaux. There then followed an exhaustive comparison of details, and a moment\\r\\nof really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the\\r\\nphrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart. What, in substance, both\\r\\nthe Esquimau wizards and the Louisiana swamp-priests had chanted to their kindred idols was\\r\\nsomething very like this—the word-divisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in\\r\\nthe phrase as chanted aloud:\\n“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl\\r\\nfhtagn.”\\nLegrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among his\\r\\nmongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant. This\\r\\ntext, as given, ran something like this:\\n“In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.”\\nAnd now, in response to a general and urgent demand, Inspector Legrasse related\\r\\nas fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshippers; telling a story to which I could\\r\\nsee my uncle attached profound significance. It savoured of the wildest dreams of myth-maker\\r\\nand theosophist, and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such half-castes\\r\\nand pariahs as might be least expected to possess it.\\nOn November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a frantic summons\\r\\nfrom the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters there, mostly primitive but good-natured\\r\\ndescendants of Lafitte’s men, were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which\\r\\nhad stolen upon them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible\\r\\nsort than they had ever known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the\\r\\nmalevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where\\r\\nno dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling chants and\\r\\ndancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added, the people could stand it no more.\\nSo a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set\\r\\nout in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of the passable\\r\\nroad they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods\\r\\nwhere day never came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and\\r\\nnow and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of\\r\\nmorbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to\\r\\ncreate. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight; and hysterical\\r\\ndwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms\\r\\nwas now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when\\r\\nthe wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through the pale undergrowth beyond\\r\\nendless avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the cowed\\r\\nsquatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship, so\\r\\nInspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror\\r\\nthat none of them had ever trod before.\\nThe region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute,\\r\\nsubstantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed\\r\\nby mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and\\r\\nsquatters whispered that bat-winged devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship\\r\\nit at midnight. They said it had been there before D’Iberville, before La Salle, before\\r\\nthe Indians, and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself,\\r\\nand to see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to keep away. The present\\r\\nvoodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location was bad\\r\\nenough; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the\\r\\nshocking sounds and incidents.\\nOnly poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasse’s\\r\\nmen as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and the muffled tom-toms.\\r\\nThere are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is\\r\\nterrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other. Animal fury and orgiastic licence\\r\\nhere whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and\\r\\nreverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell.\\r\\nNow and then the less organised ululation would cease, and from what seemed a well-drilled chorus\\r\\nof hoarse voices would rise in sing-song chant that hideous phrase or ritual:\\n“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl\\r\\nfhtagn.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came suddenly in sight of\\r\\nthe spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two were shaken into a frantic cry\\r\\nwhich the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the\\r\\nface of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotised with horror.\\nIn a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre’s\\r\\nextent, clear of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable\\r\\nhorde of human abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarola could paint. Void of clothing,\\r\\nthis hybrid spawn were braying, bellowing, and writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped bonfire;\\r\\nin the centre of which, revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame, stood a great\\r\\ngranite monolith some eight feet in height; on top of which, incongruous with its diminutiveness,\\r\\nrested the noxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular intervals\\r\\nwith the flame-girt monolith as a centre hung, head downward, the oddly marred bodies of the\\r\\nhelpless squatters who had disappeared. It was inside this circle that the ring of worshippers\\r\\njumped and roared, the general direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless\\r\\nBacchanal between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire.\\nIt may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced\\r\\none of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual\\r\\nfrom some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror. This\\r\\nman, Joseph D. Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly imaginative.\\r\\nHe indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining\\r\\neyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees—but I suppose he had been\\r\\nhearing too much native superstition.\\nActually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration.\\r\\nDuty came first; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the\\r\\nthrong, the police relied on their firearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout.\\r\\nFor five minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description. Wild blows were struck,\\r\\nshots were fired, and escapes were made; but in the end Legrasse was able to count some forty-seven\\r\\nsullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows of policemen.\\r\\nFive of the worshippers lay dead, and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised\\r\\nstretchers by their fellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully removed\\r\\nand carried back by Legrasse.\\nExamined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness, the\\r\\nprisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and mentally aberrant type. Most\\r\\nwere seamen, and a sprinkling of negroes and mulattoes, largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese\\r\\nfrom the Cape Verde Islands, gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult. But before\\r\\nmany questions were asked, it became manifest that something far deeper and older than negro\\r\\nfetichism was involved. Degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprising\\r\\nconsistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith.\\nThey worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there\\r\\nwere any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now,\\r\\ninside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to\\r\\nthe first men, who formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the prisoners\\r\\nsaid it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places\\r\\nall over the world until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the\\r\\nmighty city of R’lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath\\r\\nhis sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would always\\r\\nbe waiting to liberate him.\\nMeanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture could\\r\\nnot extract. Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth, for shapes\\r\\ncame out of the dark to visit the faithful few. But these were not the Great Old Ones. No man\\r\\nhad ever seen the Old Ones. The carven idol was great Cthulhu, but none might say whether or\\r\\nnot the others were precisely like him. No one could read the old writing now, but things were\\r\\ntold by word of mouth. The chanted ritual was not the secret—that was never spoken aloud,\\r\\nonly whispered. The chant meant only this: “In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu\\r\\nwaits dreaming.”\\nOnly two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and the rest\\r\\nwere committed to various institutions. All denied a part in the ritual murders, and averred\\r\\nthat the killing had been done by Black Winged Ones which had come to them from their immemorial\\r\\nmeeting-place in the haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no coherent account could\\r\\never be gained. What the police did extract, came mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named\\r\\nCastro, who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the cult\\r\\nin the mountains of China.\\nOld Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of\\r\\ntheosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. There had been aeons\\r\\nwhen other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities. Remains of Them, he said\\r\\nthe deathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in\\r\\nthe Pacific. They all died vast epochs of time before men came, but there were arts which could\\r\\nrevive Them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity.\\r\\nThey had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought Their images with Them.\\nThese Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether of flesh\\r\\nand blood. They had shape—for did not this star-fashioned image prove it?—but that\\r\\nshape was not made of matter. When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world\\r\\nthrough the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They no longer\\r\\nlived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R’lyeh,\\r\\npreserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the\\r\\nearth might once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside must serve\\r\\nto liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved Them intact likewise prevented Them from\\r\\nmaking an initial move, and They could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted\\r\\nmillions of years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe, but Their mode\\r\\nof speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When, after infinities\\r\\nof chaos, the first men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding\\r\\ntheir dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of mammals.\\nThen, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult around small idols\\r\\nwhich the Great Ones shewed them; idols brought in dim aeras from dark stars. That cult would\\r\\nnever die till the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from\\r\\nHis tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would be easy to know,\\r\\nfor then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and\\r\\nevil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy.\\r\\nThen the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy\\r\\nthemselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile\\r\\nthe cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow\\r\\nforth the prophecy of their return.\\nIn the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in dreams,\\r\\nbut then something had happened. The great stone city R’lyeh, with its monoliths and sepulchres,\\r\\nhad sunk beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full of the one primal mystery through which\\r\\nnot even thought can pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse. But memory never died, and\\r\\nhigh-priests said that the city would rise again when the stars were right. Then came out of\\r\\nthe earth the black spirits of earth, mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours picked up\\r\\nin caverns beneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speak much. He cut\\r\\nhimself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction.\\r\\nThe size of the Old Ones, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said\\r\\nthat he thought the centre lay amid the pathless deserts of Arabia, where Irem, the City of\\r\\nPillars, dreams hidden and untouched. It was not allied to the European witch-cult, and was\\r\\nvirtually unknown beyond its members. No book had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless\\r\\nChinamen said that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul\\r\\nAlhazred which the initiated might read as they chose, especially the much-discussed couplet:\\r\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is not dead which can eternal lie,\\r\\n            And with strange aeons even death may die.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLegrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired in vain\\r\\nconcerning the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro, apparently, had told the truth when\\r\\nhe said that it was wholly secret. The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light\\r\\nupon either cult or image, and now the detective had come to the highest authorities in the\\r\\ncountry and met with no more than the Greenland tale of Professor Webb.\\nThe feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasse’s tale, corroborated\\r\\nas it was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who attended;\\r\\nalthough scant mention occurs in the formal publications of the society. Caution is the first\\r\\ncare of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture. Legrasse for some time\\r\\nlent the image to Professor Webb, but at the latter’s death it was returned to him and\\r\\nremains in his possession, where I viewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and\\r\\nunmistakably akin to the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.\\nThat my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for\\r\\nwhat thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Legrasse had learned of the\\r\\ncult, of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics\\r\\nof the swamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come in his dreams upon\\r\\nat least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by Esquimau diabolists and\\r\\nmongrel Louisianans? Professor Angell’s instant start on an investigation of the utmost\\r\\nthoroughness was eminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having heard\\r\\nof the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and\\r\\ncontinue the mystery at my uncle’s expense. The dream-narratives and cuttings collected\\r\\nby the professor were, of course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the\\r\\nextravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions.\\r\\nSo, after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological\\r\\nnotes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor and\\r\\ngive him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man.\\nWilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas Street, a hideous\\r\\nVictorian imitation of seventeenth-century Breton architecture which flaunts its stuccoed front\\r\\namidst the lovely colonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the very shadow of the finest\\r\\nGeorgian steeple in America. I found him at work in his rooms, and at once conceded from the\\r\\nspecimens scattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic. He will, I believe,\\r\\nsome time be heard from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallised in clay and will\\r\\none day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which Arthur Machen evokes in prose,\\r\\nand Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in verse and in painting.\\nDark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock\\r\\nand asked me my business without rising. When I told him who I was, he displayed some interest;\\r\\nfor my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams, yet had never explained\\r\\nthe reason for the study. I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought with some\\r\\nsubtlety to draw him out. In a short time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity, for\\r\\nhe spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their subconscious residuum\\r\\nhad influenced his art profoundly, and he shewed me a morbid statue whose contours almost made\\r\\nme shake with the potency of its black suggestion. He could not recall having seen the original\\r\\nof this thing except in his own dream bas-relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly\\r\\nunder his hands. It was, no doubt, the giant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he really\\r\\nknew nothing of the hidden cult, save from what my uncle’s relentless catechism had let\\r\\nfall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which he could possibly\\r\\nhave received the weird impressions.\\nHe talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see with terrible\\r\\nvividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone—whose geometry, he oddly\\r\\nsaid, was all wrong—and hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless, half-mental\\r\\ncalling from underground: “Cthulhu fhtagn”, “Cthulhu fhtagn”.\\r\\nThese words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhu’s dream-vigil\\r\\nin his stone vault at R’lyeh, and I felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs. Wilcox,\\r\\nI was sure, had heard of the cult in some casual way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass\\r\\nof his equally weird reading and imagining. Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, it\\r\\nhad found subconscious expression in dreams, in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I\\r\\nnow beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one. The youth was\\r\\nof a type, at once slightly affected and slightly ill-mannered, which I could never like; but\\r\\nI was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty. I took leave of him amicably,\\r\\nand wish him all the success his talent promises.\\nThe matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times I had visions\\r\\nof personal fame from researches into its origin and connexions. I visited New Orleans, talked\\r\\nwith Legrasse and others of that old-time raiding-party, saw the frightful image, and even questioned\\r\\nsuch of the mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Castro, unfortunately, had been dead for\\r\\nsome years. What I now heard so graphically at first-hand, though it was really no more than\\r\\na detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I felt sure that\\r\\nI was on the track of a very real, very secret, and very ancient religion whose discovery would\\r\\nmake me an anthropologist of note. My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, as\\r\\nI wish it still were, and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence\\r\\nof the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by Professor Angell.\\nOne thing I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my\\r\\nuncle’s death was far from natural. He fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an\\r\\nancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from a negro sailor.\\r\\nI did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cult-members in Louisiana, and would\\r\\nnot be surprised to learn of secret methods and poison needles as ruthless and as anciently\\r\\nknown as the cryptic rites and beliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone;\\r\\nbut in Norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper inquiries of my\\r\\nuncle after encountering the sculptor’s data have come to sinister ears? I think Professor\\r\\nAngell died because he knew too much, or because he was likely to learn too much. Whether I\\r\\nshall go as he did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now.\\nIII.The Madness from the Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere\\r\\nchance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on which I\\r\\nwould naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of an\\r\\nAustralian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting\\r\\nbureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle’s\\r\\nresearch.\\nI had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the\\r\\n“Cthulhu Cult”, and was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, New Jersey; the curator\\r\\nof a local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one day the reserve specimens roughly\\r\\nset on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture\\r\\nin one of the old papers spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have\\r\\nmentioned, for my friend has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture\\r\\nwas a half-tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found\\r\\nin the swamp.\\nEagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in\\r\\ndetail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What it suggested, however,\\r\\nwas of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate\\r\\naction. It read as follows:\\nMYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA\\r\\nVigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow.\\r\\nOne Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of\\r\\nDesperate Battle and Deaths at Sea.\\r\\nRescued Seaman Refuses\\r\\nParticulars of Strange Experience.\\r\\nOdd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry\\r\\nto Follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Morrison Co.’s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this morning\\r\\nat its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam\\r\\nyacht Alert of Dunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34° 21′,\\r\\nW. Longitude 152° 17′ with one living and one dead man aboard.\\nThe Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2nd was driven\\r\\nconsiderably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves. On April 12th\\r\\nthe derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain\\r\\none survivor in a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more\\r\\nthan a week. The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about a foot\\r\\nin height, regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and the\\r\\nMuseum in College Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says he found\\r\\nin the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern.\\nThis man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of\\r\\npiracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been\\r\\nsecond mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February\\r\\n20th with a complement of eleven men. The Emma, he says, was delayed and thrown widely\\r\\nsouth of her course by the great storm of March 1st, and on March 22nd, in S. Latitude 49°\\r\\n51′, W. Longitude 128° 34′, encountered the Alert, manned by a queer and evil-looking\\r\\ncrew of Kanakas and half-castes. Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused;\\r\\nwhereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner with\\r\\na peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yacht’s equipment. The\\r\\nEmma’s men shewed fight, says the survivor, and though the schooner began to sink\\r\\nfrom shots beneath the waterline they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board her,\\r\\ngrappling with the savage crew on the yacht’s deck, and being forced to kill them all,\\r\\nthe number being slightly superior, because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though\\r\\nrather clumsy mode of fighting.\\nThree of the Emma’s men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate\\r\\nGreen, were killed; and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to navigate\\r\\nthe captured yacht, going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering\\r\\nback had existed. The next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although\\r\\nnone is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though\\r\\nJohansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling\\r\\ninto a rock chasm. Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage\\r\\nher, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd. From that time till his rescue on the\\r\\n12th the man remembers little, and he does not even recall when William Briden, his companion,\\r\\ndied. Briden’s death reveals no apparent cause, and was probably due to excitement or\\r\\nexposure. Cable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an\\r\\nisland trader, and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront. It was owned by a curious group\\r\\nof half-castes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity;\\r\\nand it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors of March 1st. Our\\r\\nAuckland correspondent gives the Emma and her crew an excellent reputation, and Johansen\\r\\nis described as a sober and worthy man. The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole\\r\\nmatter beginning tomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce Johansen to speak more\\r\\nfreely than he has done hitherto.\\nThis was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what a train\\r\\nof ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence\\r\\nthat it had strange interests at sea as well as on land. What motive prompted the hybrid crew\\r\\nto order back the Emma as they sailed about with their hideous idol? What was the unknown\\r\\nisland on which six of the Emma’s crew had died, and about which the mate Johansen\\r\\nwas so secretive? What had the vice-admiralty’s investigation brought out, and what was\\r\\nknown of the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvellous of all, what deep and more than natural\\r\\nlinkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance to the various\\r\\nturns of events so carefully noted by my uncle?\\nMarch 1st—our February 28th according to the International Date Line—the\\r\\nearthquake and storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew had darted\\r\\neagerly forth as if imperiously summoned, and on the other side of the earth poets and artists\\r\\nhad begun to dream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had moulded in\\r\\nhis sleep the form of the dreaded Cthulhu. March 23d the crew of the Emma landed on an\\r\\nunknown island and left six men dead; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a\\r\\nheightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster’s malign pursuit, whilst\\r\\nan architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium! And what of this\\r\\nstorm of April 2nd—the date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged\\r\\nunharmed from the bondage of strange fever? What of all this—and of those hints of old\\r\\nCastro about the sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign; their faithful cult and\\r\\ntheir mastery of dreams? Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man’s\\r\\npower to bear? If so, they must be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the second of\\r\\nApril had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of mankind’s soul.\\nThat evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my host\\r\\nadieu and took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month I was in Dunedin; where, however,\\r\\nI found that little was known of the strange cult-members who had lingered in the old sea-taverns.\\r\\nWaterfront scum was far too common for special mention; though there was vague talk about one\\r\\ninland trip these mongrels had made, during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on\\r\\nthe distant hills. In Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with yellow hair turned\\r\\nwhite after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at Sydney, and had thereafter sold\\r\\nhis cottage in West Street and sailed with his wife to his old home in Oslo. Of his stirring\\r\\nexperience he would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty officials, and all\\r\\nthey could do was to give me his Oslo address.\\nAfter that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members\\r\\nof the vice-admiralty court. I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, at Circular\\r\\nQuay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing from its non-committal bulk. The crouching image with\\r\\nits cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal, was preserved in the\\r\\nMuseum at Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well, finding it a thing of balefully exquisite\\r\\nworkmanship, and with the same utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness\\r\\nof material which I had noted in Legrasse’s smaller specimen. Geologists, the curator\\r\\ntold me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed that the world held no rock like it.\\r\\nThen I thought with a shudder of what old Castro had told Legrasse about the primal Great Ones:\\r\\n“They had come from the stars, and had brought Their images with Them.”\\nShaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now resolved\\r\\nto visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I reëmbarked at once for the Norwegian\\r\\ncapital; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of the Egeberg. Johansen’s\\r\\naddress, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the name\\r\\nof Oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as “Christiana”.\\r\\nI made the brief trip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and\\r\\nancient building with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black answered my summons, and I\\r\\nwas stung with disappointment when she told me in halting English that Gustaf Johansen was no\\r\\nmore.\\nHe had not survived his return, said his wife, for the doings at sea in 1925\\r\\nhad broken him. He had told her no more than he had told the public, but had left a long manuscript—of\\r\\n“technical matters” as he said—written in English, evidently in order to safeguard\\r\\nher from the peril of casual perusal. During a walk through a narrow lane near the Gothenburg\\r\\ndock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic window had knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors\\r\\nat once helped him to his feet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physicians\\r\\nfound no adequate cause for the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitution.\\nI now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me\\r\\ntill I, too, am at rest; “accidentally” or otherwise. Persuading the widow that\\r\\nmy connexion with her husband’s “technical matters” was sufficient to entitle\\r\\nme to his manuscript, I bore the document away and began to read it on the London boat. It was\\r\\na simple, rambling thing—a naive sailor’s effort at a post-facto diary—and\\r\\nstrove to recall day by day that last awful voyage. I cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim\\r\\nin all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to shew why the sound\\r\\nof the water against the vessel’s sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped my\\r\\nears with cotton.\\nJohansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the city and\\r\\nthe Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly\\r\\nbehind life in time and in space, and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which\\r\\ndream beneath the sea, known and favoured by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them\\r\\non the world whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the\\r\\nsun and air.\\nJohansen’s voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty.\\r\\nThe Emma, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force\\r\\nof that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that\\r\\nfilled men’s dreams. Once more under control, the ship was making good progress when held\\r\\nup by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate’s regret as he wrote of\\r\\nher bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant\\r\\nhorror. There was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction\\r\\nseem almost a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought\\r\\nagainst his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity\\r\\nin their captured yacht under Johansen’s command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking\\r\\nout of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47° 9′, W. Longitude 126° 43′ come upon a coast-line\\r\\nof mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible\\r\\nsubstance of earth’s supreme terror—the nightmare corpse-city of R’lyeh, that\\r\\nwas built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down\\r\\nfrom the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and\\r\\nsending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams\\r\\nof the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation\\r\\nand restoration. All this Johansen did not suspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!\\nI suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned citadel\\r\\nwhereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I think of the extent\\r\\nof all that may be brooding down there I almost wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and\\r\\nhis men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder daemons, and must\\r\\nhave guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet. Awe at the\\r\\nunbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith,\\r\\nand at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the queer image\\r\\nfound in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible in every line of the mate’s\\r\\nfrightened description.\\nWithout knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close\\r\\nto it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing any definite structure or building,\\r\\nhe dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces—surfaces too great\\r\\nto belong to any thing right or proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and\\r\\nhieroglyphs. I mention his talk about angles because it suggests something Wilcox had\\r\\ntold me of his awful dreams. He had said that the geometry of the dream-place he saw\\r\\nwas abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours.\\r\\nNow an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality.\\nJohansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous Acropolis,\\r\\nand clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase.\\r\\nThe very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarising miasma welling out\\r\\nfrom this sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily\\r\\nelusive angles of carven rock where a second glance shewed concavity after the first shewed\\r\\nconvexity.\\nSomething very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything\\r\\nmore definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each would have fled had he not feared the\\r\\nscorn of the others, and it was only half-heartedly that they searched—vainly, as it proved—for\\r\\nsome portable souvenir to bear away.\\nIt was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and\\r\\nshouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked curiously at the immense carved\\r\\ndoor with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door;\\r\\nand they all felt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around\\r\\nit, though they could not decide whether it lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an outside\\r\\ncellar-door. As Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not\\r\\nbe sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative position of everything\\r\\nelse seemed phantasmally variable.\\nBriden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then Donovan felt\\r\\nover it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went. He climbed interminably\\r\\nalong the grotesque stone moulding—that is, one would call it climbing if the thing was\\r\\nnot after all horizontal—and the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so\\r\\nvast. Then, very softly and slowly, the acre-great panel began to give inward at the top; and\\r\\nthey saw that it was balanced. Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb\\r\\nand rejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven\\r\\nportal. In this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a diagonal way, so\\r\\nthat all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upset.\\nThe aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness\\r\\nwas indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought\\r\\nto have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment,\\r\\nvisibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous\\r\\nwings. The odour arising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared\\r\\nHawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone\\r\\nwas listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous\\r\\ngreen immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of\\r\\nmadness.\\nPoor Johansen’s handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of\\r\\nthe six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed\\r\\ninstant. The Thing cannot be described—there is no language for such abysms of shrieking\\r\\nand immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order.\\r\\nA mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth a great architect went\\r\\nmad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the\\r\\ngreen, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and\\r\\nwhat an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident.\\r\\nAfter vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.\\nThree men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. God rest\\r\\nthem, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan, Guerrera, and Ångstrom.\\r\\nParker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green-crusted\\r\\nrock to the boat, and Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn’t\\r\\nhave been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Briden\\r\\nand Johansen reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous\\r\\nmonstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of the water.\\nSteam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all\\r\\nhands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down\\r\\nbetween wheel and engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors\\r\\nof that indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of\\r\\nthat charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered\\r\\nlike Polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops,\\r\\ngreat Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising strokes\\r\\nof cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing\\r\\nat intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.\\nBut Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely overtake\\r\\nthe Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and, setting the\\r\\nengine for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty\\r\\neddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave\\r\\nNorwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth\\r\\nlike the stern of a daemon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came nearly up\\r\\nto the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Johansen drove on relentlessly. There was a bursting\\r\\nas of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of a thousand\\r\\nopened graves, and a sound that the chronicler would not put on paper. For an instant the ship\\r\\nwas befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then there was only a venomous seething\\r\\nastern; where—God in heaven!—the scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn\\r\\nwas nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened\\r\\nevery second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam.\\nThat was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and\\r\\nattended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side. He did not\\r\\ntry to navigate after the first bold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his\\r\\nsoul. Then came the storm of April 2nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness.\\r\\nThere is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through\\r\\nreeling universes on a comet’s tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon\\r\\nand from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted,\\r\\nhilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged mocking imps of Tartarus.\\nOut of that dream came rescue—the Vigilant, the vice-admiralty\\r\\ncourt, the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the old house by the Egeberg.\\r\\nHe could not tell—they would think him mad. He would write of what he knew before death\\r\\ncame, but his wife must not guess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories.\\nThat was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside\\r\\nthe bas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall go this record of mine—this\\r\\ntest of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may never be pieced together\\r\\nagain. I have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of\\r\\nspring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my\\r\\nlife will be long. As my uncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much,\\r\\nand the cult still lives.\\nCthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has\\r\\nshielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant\\r\\nsailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance\\r\\nand slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking\\r\\nwhilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy.\\r\\nWho knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness waits\\r\\nand dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men. A time will come—but\\r\\nI must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript, my executors\\r\\nmay put caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReturn to “The Call of Cthulhu”\\nThis page last revised 20 August 2009.\\n\\n\\nURL:https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nContact Us\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSite Map\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSearch\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa01998–2024\\xa0by\\xa0Donovan\\xa0K.\\xa0Loucks.

We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity,\\r\\nand it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction,\\r\\nhave hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will\\r\\nopen up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall\\r\\neither go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of\\r\\na new dark age.\\nTheosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein\\r\\nour world and human race form transient incidents.

I think that\\r\\nthe professor, too, intended to keep silent regarding the part he knew, and that he would have\\r\\ndestroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him.\\nMy knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926–27 with the death\\r\\nof my grand-uncle George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brown University,\\r\\nProvidence, Rhode Island. Professor Angell was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions,\\r\\nand had frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums; so that his passing at\\r\\nthe age of ninety-two may be recalled by many. Locally, interest was intensified by the obscurity\\r\\nof the cause of death. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the Newport boat;\\r\\nfalling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical-looking negro who\\r\\nhad come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short\\r\\ncut from the waterfront to the deceased’s home in Williams Street. Physicians were unable\\r\\nto find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion\\r\\nof the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible\\r\\nfor the end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but latterly I am inclined\\r\\nto wonder—and more than wonder.\\nAs my grand-uncle’s heir and executor, for he died a childless widower,\\r\\nI was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purpose moved his\\r\\nentire set of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of the material which I correlated\\r\\nwill be later published by the American Archaeological Society, but there was one box which\\r\\nI found exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much averse from shewing to other eyes. It had\\r\\nbeen locked, and I did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal ring\\r\\nwhich the professor carried always in his pocket. Then indeed I succeeded in opening it, but\\r\\nwhen I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more closely locked barrier. For\\r\\nwhat could be the meaning of the queer clay bas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings,\\r\\nand cuttings which I found? Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the most\\r\\nsuperficial impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this\\r\\napparent disturbance of an old man’s peace of mind.\\nThe bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five\\r\\nby six inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs, however, were far from modern\\r\\nin atmosphere and suggestion; for although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and\\r\\nwild, they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing.\\r\\nAnd writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be; though my memory,\\r\\ndespite much familiarity with the papers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify\\r\\nthis particular species, or even to hint at its remotest affiliations.\\nAbove these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial intent,\\r\\nthough its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. It seemed to be\\r\\na sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could\\r\\nconceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of\\r\\nan octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the\\r\\nthing. A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings;\\r\\nbut it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful.\\r\\nBehind the figure was a vague suggestion of a Cyclopean architectural background.\\nThe writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of press cuttings,\\r\\nin Professor Angell’s most recent hand; and made no pretence to literary style. What seemed\\r\\nto be the main document was headed “CTHULHU CULT” in characters painstakingly printed\\r\\nto avoid the erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of. The manuscript was divided into two\\r\\nsections, the first of which was headed “1925—Dream and Dream Work of H. A. Wilcox,\\r\\n7 Thomas St., Providence, R.I.”, and the second, “Narrative of Inspector John R.\\r\\nLegrasse, 121 Bienville St., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg.—Notes on Same, &\\r\\nProf. Webb’s Acct.” The other manuscript papers were all brief notes, some of them\\r\\naccounts of the queer dreams of different persons, some of them citations from theosophical\\r\\nbooks and magazines (notably W. Scott-Elliot’s Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria),\\r\\nand the rest comments on long-surviving secret societies and hidden cults, with references to\\r\\npassages in such mythological and anthropological source-books as Frazer’s Golden Bough\\r\\nand Miss Murray’s Witch-Cult in Western Europe. The cuttings largely alluded to\\r\\noutré mental illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925.\\nThe first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale. It appears\\r\\nthat on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon\\r\\nProfessor Angell bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and fresh.\\r\\nHis card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle had recognised him as the youngest\\r\\nson of an excellent family slightly known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at\\r\\nthe Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near that institution.\\r\\nWilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity, and had from childhood\\r\\nexcited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating.\\r\\nHe called himself “psychically hypersensitive”, but the staid folk of the ancient\\r\\ncommercial city dismissed him as merely “queer”. Never mingling much with his kind,\\r\\nhe had dropped gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a small group of\\r\\naesthetes from other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its conservatism,\\r\\nhad found him quite hopeless.\\nOn the occasion of the visit, ran the professor’s manuscript, the sculptor\\r\\nabruptly asked for the benefit of his host’s archaeological knowledge in identifying the\\r\\nhieroglyphics on the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and\\r\\nalienated sympathy; and my uncle shewed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness\\r\\nof the tablet implied kinship with anything but archaeology. Young Wilcox’s rejoinder,\\r\\nwhich impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically\\r\\npoetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since found highly\\r\\ncharacteristic of him. He said, “It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream\\r\\nof strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or\\r\\ngarden-girdled Babylon.”\\nIt was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping\\r\\nmemory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a slight earthquake tremor the\\r\\nnight before, the most considerable felt in New England for some years; and Wilcox’s imagination\\r\\nhad been keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean\\r\\ncities of titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with\\r\\nlatent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point\\r\\nbelow had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute\\r\\ninto sound, but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters,\\r\\n“Cthulhu fhtagn”.\\nThis verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed\\r\\nProfessor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; and studied with almost\\r\\nfrantic intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad\\r\\nonly in his night-clothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his\\r\\nold age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness in recognising both hieroglyphics and pictorial\\r\\ndesign. Many of his questions seemed highly out-of-place to his visitor, especially those which\\r\\ntried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand\\r\\nthe repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership\\r\\nin some widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor Angell became convinced\\r\\nthat the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his\\r\\nvisitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for after the first\\r\\ninterview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man, during which he related startling\\r\\nfragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark\\r\\nand dripping stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical\\r\\nsense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds most frequently repeated are those\\r\\nrendered by the letters “Cthulhu” and “R’lyeh”.\\nOn March 23d, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiries\\r\\nat his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to\\r\\nthe home of his family in Waterman Street. He had cried out in the night, arousing several other\\r\\nartists in the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness\\r\\nand delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close\\r\\nwatch of the case; calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to\\r\\nbe in charge. The youth’s febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things; and\\r\\nthe doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them. They included not only a repetition of\\r\\nwhat he had formerly dreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing “miles high”\\r\\nwhich walked or lumbered about. He at no time fully described this object, but occasional frantic\\r\\nwords, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the professor that it must be identical with the\\r\\nnameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this object,\\r\\nthe doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man’s subsidence into lethargy.\\r\\nHis temperature, oddly enough, was not greatly above normal; but his whole condition was otherwise\\r\\nsuch as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder.\\nOn April 2nd at about 3 p.m. every trace of Wilcox’s malady suddenly\\r\\nceased. He sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of\\r\\nwhat had happened in dream or reality since the night of March 22nd. Pronounced well by his\\r\\nphysician, he returned to his quarters in three days; but to Professor Angell he was of no further\\r\\nassistance. All traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept\\r\\nno record of his night-thoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly\\r\\nusual visions.\\nHere the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain of the\\r\\nscattered notes gave me much material for thought—so much, in fact, that only the ingrained\\r\\nscepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the artist. The\\r\\nnotes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same\\r\\nperiod as that in which young Wilcox had had his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had\\r\\nquickly instituted a prodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends\\r\\nwhom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and\\r\\nthe dates of any notable visions for some time past. The reception of his request seems to have\\r\\nbeen varied; but he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any ordinary\\r\\nman could have handled without a secretary. This original correspondence was not preserved,\\r\\nbut his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest. Average people in society and\\r\\nbusiness—New England’s traditional “salt of the earth”—gave an\\r\\nalmost completely negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions\\r\\nappear here and there, always between March 23d and April 2nd—the period of young Wilcox’s\\r\\ndelirium. Scientific men were little more affected, though four cases of vague description suggest\\r\\nfugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something\\r\\nabnormal.\\nIt was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I know\\r\\nthat panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes. As it was, lacking their\\r\\noriginal letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having\\r\\nedited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see. That is\\r\\nwhy I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed,\\r\\nhad been imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from aesthetes told a disturbing\\r\\ntale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things,\\r\\nthe intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor’s\\r\\ndelirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported scenes and half-sounds not\\r\\nunlike those which Wilcox had described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the\\r\\ngigantic nameless thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with emphasis,\\r\\nwas very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism,\\r\\nwent violently insane on the date of young Wilcox’s seizure, and expired several months\\r\\nlater after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle\\r\\nreferred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration\\r\\nand personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these,\\r\\nhowever, bore out the notes in full. I have often wondered if all the objects of the professor’s\\r\\nquestioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever\\r\\nreach them.\\nThe press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania,\\r\\nand eccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell must have employed a cutting bureau,\\r\\nfor the number of extracts was tremendous and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here\\r\\nwas a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking\\r\\ncry. Here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic\\r\\ndeduces a dire future from visions he has seen. A despatch from California describes a theosophist\\r\\ncolony as donning white robes en masse for some “glorious fulfilment” which never\\r\\narrives, whilst items from India speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of\\r\\nMarch. Voodoo orgies multiply in Hayti, and African outposts report ominous mutterings. American\\r\\nofficers in the Philippines find certain tribes bothersome about this time, and New York policemen\\r\\nare mobbed by hysterical Levantines on the night of March 22–23. The west of Ireland,\\r\\ntoo, is full of wild rumour and legendry, and a fantastic painter named Ardois-Bonnot hangs\\r\\na blasphemous “Dream Landscape” in the Paris spring salon of 1926. And so numerous\\r\\nare the recorded troubles in insane asylums, that only a miracle can have stopped the medical\\r\\nfraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions. A weird bunch\\r\\nof cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with\\r\\nwhich I set them aside. But I was then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters\\r\\nmentioned by the professor.\\nII.The Tale of Inspector Legrasse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe older matters which had made the sculptor’s dream and bas-relief so significant to\\r\\nmy uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript. Once before, it appears,\\r\\nProfessor Angell had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the\\r\\nunknown hieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as “Cthulhu”;\\r\\nand all this in so stirring and horrible a connexion that it is small wonder he pursued young\\r\\nWilcox with queries and demands for data.\\nThe earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when the American\\r\\nArchaeological Society held its annual meeting in St. Louis. Professor Angell, as befitted one\\r\\nof his authority and attainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was\\r\\none of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation\\r\\nto offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solution.\\nThe chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for\\r\\nthe entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had travelled all the way\\r\\nfrom New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source. His name\\r\\nwas John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an Inspector of Police. With him he bore\\r\\nthe subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette\\r\\nwhose origin he was at a loss to determine. It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had\\r\\nthe least interest in archaeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted\\r\\nby purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, or whatever it was, had\\r\\nbeen captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on\\r\\na supposed voodoo meeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it, that\\r\\nthe police could not but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them,\\r\\nand infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of its origin,\\r\\napart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members, absolutely\\r\\nnothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which\\r\\nmight help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain-head.\\nInspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering\\r\\ncreated. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a\\r\\nstate of tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive\\r\\nfigure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at\\r\\nunopened and archaic vistas. No recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object,\\r\\nyet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of\\r\\nunplaceable stone.\\nThe figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful\\r\\nstudy, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship.\\r\\nIt represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose\\r\\nface was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore\\r\\nfeet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural\\r\\nmalignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block\\r\\nor pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings touched the back edge\\r\\nof the block, the seat occupied the centre, whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up,\\r\\ncrouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the\\r\\nbottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facial\\r\\nfeelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher’s elevated knees.\\r\\nThe aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, and the more subtly fearful because its source\\r\\nwas so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was unmistakable; yet not one\\r\\nlink did it shew with any known type of art belonging to civilisation’s youth—or\\r\\nindeed to any other time. Totally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the\\r\\nsoapy, greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing\\r\\nfamiliar to geology or mineralogy. The characters along the base were equally baffling; and\\r\\nno member present, despite a representation of half the world’s expert learning in this\\r\\nfield, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship. They, like the\\r\\nsubject and material, belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we\\r\\nknow it; something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our\\r\\nworld and our conceptions have no part.\\nAnd yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at\\r\\nthe Inspector’s problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of\\r\\nbizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence\\r\\nof the odd trifle he knew. This person was the late William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology\\r\\nin Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note. Professor Webb had been engaged,\\r\\nforty-eight years before, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions\\r\\nwhich he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast had encountered a\\r\\nsingular tribe or cult of degenerate Esquimaux whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship,\\r\\nchilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which\\r\\nother Esquimaux knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had\\r\\ncome down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made. Besides nameless rites\\r\\nand human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder\\r\\ndevil or tornasuk; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from\\r\\nan aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew\\r\\nhow. But just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around\\r\\nwhich they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the professor stated,\\r\\na very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing. And\\r\\nso far as he could tell, it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing\\r\\nnow lying before the meeting.\\nThis data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members,\\r\\nproved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at once to ply his informant with\\r\\nquestions. Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp cult-worshippers his men had\\r\\narrested, he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst\\r\\nthe diabolist Esquimaux. There then followed an exhaustive comparison of details, and a moment\\r\\nof really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the\\r\\nphrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart. What, in substance, both\\r\\nthe Esquimau wizards and the Louisiana swamp-priests had chanted to their kindred idols was\\r\\nsomething very like this—the word-divisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in\\r\\nthe phrase as chanted aloud:\\n“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl\\r\\nfhtagn.”\\nLegrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among his\\r\\nmongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant. This\\r\\ntext, as given, ran something like this:\\n“In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.”\\nAnd now, in response to a general and urgent demand, Inspector Legrasse related\\r\\nas fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshippers; telling a story to which I could\\r\\nsee my uncle attached profound significance. It savoured of the wildest dreams of myth-maker\\r\\nand theosophist, and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such half-castes\\r\\nand pariahs as might be least expected to possess it.\\nOn November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a frantic summons\\r\\nfrom the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters there, mostly primitive but good-natured\\r\\ndescendants of Lafitte’s men, were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which\\r\\nhad stolen upon them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible\\r\\nsort than they had ever known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the\\r\\nmalevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where\\r\\nno dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling chants and\\r\\ndancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added, the people could stand it no more.\\nSo a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set\\r\\nout in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of the passable\\r\\nroad they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods\\r\\nwhere day never came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and\\r\\nnow and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of\\r\\nmorbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to\\r\\ncreate. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight; and hysterical\\r\\ndwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms\\r\\nwas now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when\\r\\nthe wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through the pale undergrowth beyond\\r\\nendless avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the cowed\\r\\nsquatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship, so\\r\\nInspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror\\r\\nthat none of them had ever trod before.\\nThe region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute,\\r\\nsubstantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed\\r\\nby mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and\\r\\nsquatters whispered that bat-winged devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship\\r\\nit at midnight. They said it had been there before D’Iberville, before La Salle, before\\r\\nthe Indians, and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself,\\r\\nand to see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to keep away. The present\\r\\nvoodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location was bad\\r\\nenough; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the\\r\\nshocking sounds and incidents.\\nOnly poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasse’s\\r\\nmen as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and the muffled tom-toms.\\r\\nThere are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is\\r\\nterrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other. Animal fury and orgiastic licence\\r\\nhere whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and\\r\\nreverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell.\\r\\nNow and then the less organised ululation would cease, and from what seemed a well-drilled chorus\\r\\nof hoarse voices would rise in sing-song chant that hideous phrase or ritual:\\n“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl\\r\\nfhtagn.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came suddenly in sight of\\r\\nthe spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two were shaken into a frantic cry\\r\\nwhich the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the\\r\\nface of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotised with horror.\\nIn a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre’s\\r\\nextent, clear of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable\\r\\nhorde of human abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarola could paint. Void of clothing,\\r\\nthis hybrid spawn were braying, bellowing, and writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped bonfire;\\r\\nin the centre of which, revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame, stood a great\\r\\ngranite monolith some eight feet in height; on top of which, incongruous with its diminutiveness,\\r\\nrested the noxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular intervals\\r\\nwith the flame-girt monolith as a centre hung, head downward, the oddly marred bodies of the\\r\\nhelpless squatters who had disappeared. It was inside this circle that the ring of worshippers\\r\\njumped and roared, the general direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless\\r\\nBacchanal between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire.\\nIt may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced\\r\\none of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual\\r\\nfrom some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror. This\\r\\nman, Joseph D. Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly imaginative.\\r\\nHe indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining\\r\\neyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees—but I suppose he had been\\r\\nhearing too much native superstition.\\nActually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration.\\r\\nDuty came first; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the\\r\\nthrong, the police relied on their firearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout.\\r\\nFor five minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description. Wild blows were struck,\\r\\nshots were fired, and escapes were made; but in the end Legrasse was able to count some forty-seven\\r\\nsullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows of policemen.\\r\\nFive of the worshippers lay dead, and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised\\r\\nstretchers by their fellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully removed\\r\\nand carried back by Legrasse.\\nExamined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness, the\\r\\nprisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and mentally aberrant type. Most\\r\\nwere seamen, and a sprinkling of negroes and mulattoes, largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese\\r\\nfrom the Cape Verde Islands, gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult. But before\\r\\nmany questions were asked, it became manifest that something far deeper and older than negro\\r\\nfetichism was involved. Degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprising\\r\\nconsistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith.\\nThey worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there\\r\\nwere any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now,\\r\\ninside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to\\r\\nthe first men, who formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the prisoners\\r\\nsaid it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places\\r\\nall over the world until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the\\r\\nmighty city of R’lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath\\r\\nhis sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would always\\r\\nbe waiting to liberate him.\\nMeanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture could\\r\\nnot extract. Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth, for shapes\\r\\ncame out of the dark to visit the faithful few. But these were not the Great Old Ones. No man\\r\\nhad ever seen the Old Ones. The carven idol was great Cthulhu, but none might say whether or\\r\\nnot the others were precisely like him. No one could read the old writing now, but things were\\r\\ntold by word of mouth. The chanted ritual was not the secret—that was never spoken aloud,\\r\\nonly whispered. The chant meant only this: “In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu\\r\\nwaits dreaming.”\\nOnly two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and the rest\\r\\nwere committed to various institutions. All denied a part in the ritual murders, and averred\\r\\nthat the killing had been done by Black Winged Ones which had come to them from their immemorial\\r\\nmeeting-place in the haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no coherent account could\\r\\never be gained. What the police did extract, came mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named\\r\\nCastro, who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the cult\\r\\nin the mountains of China.\\nOld Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of\\r\\ntheosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. There had been aeons\\r\\nwhen other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities. Remains of Them, he said\\r\\nthe deathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in\\r\\nthe Pacific. They all died vast epochs of time before men came, but there were arts which could\\r\\nrevive Them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity.\\r\\nThey had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought Their images with Them.\\nThese Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether of flesh\\r\\nand blood. They had shape—for did not this star-fashioned image prove it?—but that\\r\\nshape was not made of matter. When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world\\r\\nthrough the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They no longer\\r\\nlived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R’lyeh,\\r\\npreserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the\\r\\nearth might once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside must serve\\r\\nto liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved Them intact likewise prevented Them from\\r\\nmaking an initial move, and They could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted\\r\\nmillions of years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe, but Their mode\\r\\nof speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When, after infinities\\r\\nof chaos, the first men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding\\r\\ntheir dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of mammals.\\nThen, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult around small idols\\r\\nwhich the Great Ones shewed them; idols brought in dim aeras from dark stars. That cult would\\r\\nnever die till the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from\\r\\nHis tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would be easy to know,\\r\\nfor then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and\\r\\nevil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy.\\r\\nThen the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy\\r\\nthemselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile\\r\\nthe cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow\\r\\nforth the prophecy of their return.\\nIn the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in dreams,\\r\\nbut then something had happened. The great stone city R’lyeh, with its monoliths and sepulchres,\\r\\nhad sunk beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full of the one primal mystery through which\\r\\nnot even thought can pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse. But memory never died, and\\r\\nhigh-priests said that the city would rise again when the stars were right. Then came out of\\r\\nthe earth the black spirits of earth, mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours picked up\\r\\nin caverns beneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speak much. He cut\\r\\nhimself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction.\\r\\nThe size of the Old Ones, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said\\r\\nthat he thought the centre lay amid the pathless deserts of Arabia, where Irem, the City of\\r\\nPillars, dreams hidden and untouched. It was not allied to the European witch-cult, and was\\r\\nvirtually unknown beyond its members. No book had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless\\r\\nChinamen said that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul\\r\\nAlhazred which the initiated might read as they chose, especially the much-discussed couplet:\\r\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is not dead which can eternal lie,\\r\\n            And with strange aeons even death may die.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLegrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired in vain\\r\\nconcerning the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro, apparently, had told the truth when\\r\\nhe said that it was wholly secret. The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light\\r\\nupon either cult or image, and now the detective had come to the highest authorities in the\\r\\ncountry and met with no more than the Greenland tale of Professor Webb.\\nThe feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasse’s tale, corroborated\\r\\nas it was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who attended;\\r\\nalthough scant mention occurs in the formal publications of the society. Caution is the first\\r\\ncare of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture. Legrasse for some time\\r\\nlent the image to Professor Webb, but at the latter’s death it was returned to him and\\r\\nremains in his possession, where I viewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and\\r\\nunmistakably akin to the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.\\nThat my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for\\r\\nwhat thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Legrasse had learned of the\\r\\ncult, of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics\\r\\nof the swamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come in his dreams upon\\r\\nat least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by Esquimau diabolists and\\r\\nmongrel Louisianans? Professor Angell’s instant start on an investigation of the utmost\\r\\nthoroughness was eminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having heard\\r\\nof the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and\\r\\ncontinue the mystery at my uncle’s expense. The dream-narratives and cuttings collected\\r\\nby the professor were, of course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the\\r\\nextravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions.\\r\\nSo, after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological\\r\\nnotes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor and\\r\\ngive him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man.\\nWilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas Street, a hideous\\r\\nVictorian imitation of seventeenth-century Breton architecture which flaunts its stuccoed front\\r\\namidst the lovely colonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the very shadow of the finest\\r\\nGeorgian steeple in America. I found him at work in his rooms, and at once conceded from the\\r\\nspecimens scattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic. He will, I believe,\\r\\nsome time be heard from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallised in clay and will\\r\\none day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which Arthur Machen evokes in prose,\\r\\nand Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in verse and in painting.\\nDark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock\\r\\nand asked me my business without rising. When I told him who I was, he displayed some interest;\\r\\nfor my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams, yet had never explained\\r\\nthe reason for the study. I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought with some\\r\\nsubtlety to draw him out. In a short time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity, for\\r\\nhe spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their subconscious residuum\\r\\nhad influenced his art profoundly, and he shewed me a morbid statue whose contours almost made\\r\\nme shake with the potency of its black suggestion. He could not recall having seen the original\\r\\nof this thing except in his own dream bas-relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly\\r\\nunder his hands. It was, no doubt, the giant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he really\\r\\nknew nothing of the hidden cult, save from what my uncle’s relentless catechism had let\\r\\nfall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which he could possibly\\r\\nhave received the weird impressions.\\nHe talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see with terrible\\r\\nvividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone—whose geometry, he oddly\\r\\nsaid, was all wrong—and hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless, half-mental\\r\\ncalling from underground: “Cthulhu fhtagn”, “Cthulhu fhtagn”.\\r\\nThese words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhu’s dream-vigil\\r\\nin his stone vault at R’lyeh, and I felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs. Wilcox,\\r\\nI was sure, had heard of the cult in some casual way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass\\r\\nof his equally weird reading and imagining. Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, it\\r\\nhad found subconscious expression in dreams, in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I\\r\\nnow beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one. The youth was\\r\\nof a type, at once slightly affected and slightly ill-mannered, which I could never like; but\\r\\nI was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty. I took leave of him amicably,\\r\\nand wish him all the success his talent promises.\\nThe matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times I had visions\\r\\nof personal fame from researches into its origin and connexions. I visited New Orleans, talked\\r\\nwith Legrasse and others of that old-time raiding-party, saw the frightful image, and even questioned\\r\\nsuch of the mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Castro, unfortunately, had been dead for\\r\\nsome years. What I now heard so graphically at first-hand, though it was really no more than\\r\\na detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I felt sure that\\r\\nI was on the track of a very real, very secret, and very ancient religion whose discovery would\\r\\nmake me an anthropologist of note. My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, as\\r\\nI wish it still were, and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence\\r\\nof the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by Professor Angell.\\nOne thing I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my\\r\\nuncle’s death was far from natural. He fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an\\r\\nancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from a negro sailor.\\r\\nI did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cult-members in Louisiana, and would\\r\\nnot be surprised to learn of secret methods and poison needles as ruthless and as anciently\\r\\nknown as the cryptic rites and beliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone;\\r\\nbut in Norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper inquiries of my\\r\\nuncle after encountering the sculptor’s data have come to sinister ears? I think Professor\\r\\nAngell died because he knew too much, or because he was likely to learn too much. Whether I\\r\\nshall go as he did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now.\\nIII.The Madness from the Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere\\r\\nchance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on which I\\r\\nwould naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of an\\r\\nAustralian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting\\r\\nbureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle’s\\r\\nresearch.\\nI had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the\\r\\n“Cthulhu Cult”, and was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, New Jersey; the curator\\r\\nof a local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one day the reserve specimens roughly\\r\\nset on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture\\r\\nin one of the old papers spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have\\r\\nmentioned, for my friend has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture\\r\\nwas a half-tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found\\r\\nin the swamp.\\nEagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in\\r\\ndetail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What it suggested, however,\\r\\nwas of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate\\r\\naction. It read as follows:\\nMYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA\\r\\nVigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow.\\r\\nOne Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of\\r\\nDesperate Battle and Deaths at Sea.\\r\\nRescued Seaman Refuses\\r\\nParticulars of Strange Experience.\\r\\nOdd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry\\r\\nto Follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Morrison Co.’s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this morning\\r\\nat its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam\\r\\nyacht Alert of Dunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34° 21′,\\r\\nW. Longitude 152° 17′ with one living and one dead man aboard.\\nThe Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2nd was driven\\r\\nconsiderably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves. On April 12th\\r\\nthe derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain\\r\\none survivor in a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more\\r\\nthan a week. The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about a foot\\r\\nin height, regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and the\\r\\nMuseum in College Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says he found\\r\\nin the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern.\\nThis man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of\\r\\npiracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been\\r\\nsecond mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February\\r\\n20th with a complement of eleven men. The Emma, he says, was delayed and thrown widely\\r\\nsouth of her course by the great storm of March 1st, and on March 22nd, in S. Latitude 49°\\r\\n51′, W. Longitude 128° 34′, encountered the Alert, manned by a queer and evil-looking\\r\\ncrew of Kanakas and half-castes. Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused;\\r\\nwhereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner with\\r\\na peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yacht’s equipment. The\\r\\nEmma’s men shewed fight, says the survivor, and though the schooner began to sink\\r\\nfrom shots beneath the waterline they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board her,\\r\\ngrappling with the savage crew on the yacht’s deck, and being forced to kill them all,\\r\\nthe number being slightly superior, because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though\\r\\nrather clumsy mode of fighting.\\nThree of the Emma’s men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate\\r\\nGreen, were killed; and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to navigate\\r\\nthe captured yacht, going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering\\r\\nback had existed. The next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although\\r\\nnone is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though\\r\\nJohansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling\\r\\ninto a rock chasm. Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage\\r\\nher, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd. From that time till his rescue on the\\r\\n12th the man remembers little, and he does not even recall when William Briden, his companion,\\r\\ndied. Briden’s death reveals no apparent cause, and was probably due to excitement or\\r\\nexposure. Cable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an\\r\\nisland trader, and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront. It was owned by a curious group\\r\\nof half-castes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity;\\r\\nand it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors of March 1st. Our\\r\\nAuckland correspondent gives the Emma and her crew an excellent reputation, and Johansen\\r\\nis described as a sober and worthy man. The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole\\r\\nmatter beginning tomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce Johansen to speak more\\r\\nfreely than he has done hitherto.\\nThis was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what a train\\r\\nof ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence\\r\\nthat it had strange interests at sea as well as on land. What motive prompted the hybrid crew\\r\\nto order back the Emma as they sailed about with their hideous idol? What was the unknown\\r\\nisland on which six of the Emma’s crew had died, and about which the mate Johansen\\r\\nwas so secretive? What had the vice-admiralty’s investigation brought out, and what was\\r\\nknown of the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvellous of all, what deep and more than natural\\r\\nlinkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance to the various\\r\\nturns of events so carefully noted by my uncle?\\nMarch 1st—our February 28th according to the International Date Line—the\\r\\nearthquake and storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew had darted\\r\\neagerly forth as if imperiously summoned, and on the other side of the earth poets and artists\\r\\nhad begun to dream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had moulded in\\r\\nhis sleep the form of the dreaded Cthulhu. March 23d the crew of the Emma landed on an\\r\\nunknown island and left six men dead; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a\\r\\nheightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster’s malign pursuit, whilst\\r\\nan architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium! And what of this\\r\\nstorm of April 2nd—the date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged\\r\\nunharmed from the bondage of strange fever? What of all this—and of those hints of old\\r\\nCastro about the sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign; their faithful cult and\\r\\ntheir mastery of dreams? Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man’s\\r\\npower to bear? If so, they must be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the second of\\r\\nApril had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of mankind’s soul.\\nThat evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my host\\r\\nadieu and took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month I was in Dunedin; where, however,\\r\\nI found that little was known of the strange cult-members who had lingered in the old sea-taverns.\\r\\nWaterfront scum was far too common for special mention; though there was vague talk about one\\r\\ninland trip these mongrels had made, during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on\\r\\nthe distant hills. In Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with yellow hair turned\\r\\nwhite after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at Sydney, and had thereafter sold\\r\\nhis cottage in West Street and sailed with his wife to his old home in Oslo. Of his stirring\\r\\nexperience he would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty officials, and all\\r\\nthey could do was to give me his Oslo address.\\nAfter that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members\\r\\nof the vice-admiralty court. I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, at Circular\\r\\nQuay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing from its non-committal bulk. The crouching image with\\r\\nits cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal, was preserved in the\\r\\nMuseum at Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well, finding it a thing of balefully exquisite\\r\\nworkmanship, and with the same utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness\\r\\nof material which I had noted in Legrasse’s smaller specimen. Geologists, the curator\\r\\ntold me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed that the world held no rock like it.\\r\\nThen I thought with a shudder of what old Castro had told Legrasse about the primal Great Ones:\\r\\n“They had come from the stars, and had brought Their images with Them.”\\nShaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now resolved\\r\\nto visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I reëmbarked at once for the Norwegian\\r\\ncapital; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of the Egeberg. Johansen’s\\r\\naddress, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the name\\r\\nof Oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as “Christiana”.\\r\\nI made the brief trip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and\\r\\nancient building with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black answered my summons, and I\\r\\nwas stung with disappointment when she told me in halting English that Gustaf Johansen was no\\r\\nmore.\\nHe had not survived his return, said his wife, for the doings at sea in 1925\\r\\nhad broken him. He had told her no more than he had told the public, but had left a long manuscript—of\\r\\n“technical matters” as he said—written in English, evidently in order to safeguard\\r\\nher from the peril of casual perusal. During a walk through a narrow lane near the Gothenburg\\r\\ndock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic window had knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors\\r\\nat once helped him to his feet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physicians\\r\\nfound no adequate cause for the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitution.\\nI now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me\\r\\ntill I, too, am at rest; “accidentally” or otherwise. Persuading the widow that\\r\\nmy connexion with her husband’s “technical matters” was sufficient to entitle\\r\\nme to his manuscript, I bore the document away and began to read it on the London boat. It was\\r\\na simple, rambling thing—a naive sailor’s effort at a post-facto diary—and\\r\\nstrove to recall day by day that last awful voyage. I cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim\\r\\nin all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to shew why the sound\\r\\nof the water against the vessel’s sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped my\\r\\nears with cotton.\\nJohansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the city and\\r\\nthe Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly\\r\\nbehind life in time and in space, and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which\\r\\ndream beneath the sea, known and favoured by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them\\r\\non the world whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the\\r\\nsun and air.\\nJohansen’s voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty.\\r\\nThe Emma, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force\\r\\nof that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that\\r\\nfilled men’s dreams. Once more under control, the ship was making good progress when held\\r\\nup by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate’s regret as he wrote of\\r\\nher bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant\\r\\nhorror. There was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction\\r\\nseem almost a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought\\r\\nagainst his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity\\r\\nin their captured yacht under Johansen’s command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking\\r\\nout of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47° 9′, W. Longitude 126° 43′ come upon a coast-line\\r\\nof mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible\\r\\nsubstance of earth’s supreme terror—the nightmare corpse-city of R’lyeh, that\\r\\nwas built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down\\r\\nfrom the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and\\r\\nsending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams\\r\\nof the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation\\r\\nand restoration. All this Johansen did not suspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!\\nI suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned citadel\\r\\nwhereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I think of the extent\\r\\nof all that may be brooding down there I almost wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and\\r\\nhis men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder daemons, and must\\r\\nhave guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet. Awe at the\\r\\nunbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith,\\r\\nand at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the queer image\\r\\nfound in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible in every line of the mate’s\\r\\nfrightened description.\\nWithout knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close\\r\\nto it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing any definite structure or building,\\r\\nhe dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces—surfaces too great\\r\\nto belong to any thing right or proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and\\r\\nhieroglyphs. I mention his talk about angles because it suggests something Wilcox had\\r\\ntold me of his awful dreams. He had said that the geometry of the dream-place he saw\\r\\nwas abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours.\\r\\nNow an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality.\\nJohansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous Acropolis,\\r\\nand clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase.\\r\\nThe very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarising miasma welling out\\r\\nfrom this sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily\\r\\nelusive angles of carven rock where a second glance shewed concavity after the first shewed\\r\\nconvexity.\\nSomething very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything\\r\\nmore definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each would have fled had he not feared the\\r\\nscorn of the others, and it was only half-heartedly that they searched—vainly, as it proved—for\\r\\nsome portable souvenir to bear away.\\nIt was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and\\r\\nshouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked curiously at the immense carved\\r\\ndoor with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door;\\r\\nand they all felt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around\\r\\nit, though they could not decide whether it lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an outside\\r\\ncellar-door. As Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not\\r\\nbe sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative position of everything\\r\\nelse seemed phantasmally variable.\\nBriden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then Donovan felt\\r\\nover it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went. He climbed interminably\\r\\nalong the grotesque stone moulding—that is, one would call it climbing if the thing was\\r\\nnot after all horizontal—and the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so\\r\\nvast. Then, very softly and slowly, the acre-great panel began to give inward at the top; and\\r\\nthey saw that it was balanced. Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb\\r\\nand rejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven\\r\\nportal. In this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a diagonal way, so\\r\\nthat all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upset.\\nThe aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness\\r\\nwas indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought\\r\\nto have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment,\\r\\nvisibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous\\r\\nwings. The odour arising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared\\r\\nHawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone\\r\\nwas listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous\\r\\ngreen immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of\\r\\nmadness.\\nPoor Johansen’s handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of\\r\\nthe six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed\\r\\ninstant. The Thing cannot be described—there is no language for such abysms of shrieking\\r\\nand immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order.\\r\\nA mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth a great architect went\\r\\nmad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the\\r\\ngreen, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and\\r\\nwhat an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident.\\r\\nAfter vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.\\nThree men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. God rest\\r\\nthem, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan, Guerrera, and Ångstrom.\\r\\nParker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green-crusted\\r\\nrock to the boat, and Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn’t\\r\\nhave been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Briden\\r\\nand Johansen reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous\\r\\nmonstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of the water.\\nSteam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all\\r\\nhands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down\\r\\nbetween wheel and engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors\\r\\nof that indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of\\r\\nthat charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered\\r\\nlike Polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops,\\r\\ngreat Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising strokes\\r\\nof cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing\\r\\nat intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.\\nBut Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely overtake\\r\\nthe Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and, setting the\\r\\nengine for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty\\r\\neddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave\\r\\nNorwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth\\r\\nlike the stern of a daemon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came nearly up\\r\\nto the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Johansen drove on relentlessly. There was a bursting\\r\\nas of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of a thousand\\r\\nopened graves, and a sound that the chronicler would not put on paper. For an instant the ship\\r\\nwas befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then there was only a venomous seething\\r\\nastern; where—God in heaven!—the scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn\\r\\nwas nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened\\r\\nevery second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam.\\nThat was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and\\r\\nattended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side. He did not\\r\\ntry to navigate after the first bold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his\\r\\nsoul. Then came the storm of April 2nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness.\\r\\nThere is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through\\r\\nreeling universes on a comet’s tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon\\r\\nand from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted,\\r\\nhilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged mocking imps of Tartarus.\\nOut of that dream came rescue—the Vigilant, the vice-admiralty\\r\\ncourt, the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the old house by the Egeberg.\\r\\nHe could not tell—they would think him mad. He would write of what he knew before death\\r\\ncame, but his wife must not guess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories.\\nThat was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside\\r\\nthe bas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall go this record of mine—this\\r\\ntest of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may never be pieced together\\r\\nagain. I have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of\\r\\nspring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my\\r\\nlife will be long. As my uncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much,\\r\\nand the cult still lives.\\nCthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has\\r\\nshielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant\\r\\nsailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance\\r\\nand slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking\\r\\nwhilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy.\\r\\nWho knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness waits\\r\\nand dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men. A time will come—but\\r\\nI must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript, my executors\\r\\nmay put caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReturn to “The Call of Cthulhu”\\nThis page last revised 20 August 2009.\\n\\n\\nURL:https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nContact Us\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSite Map\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSearch\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa01998–2024\\xa0by\\xa0Donovan\\xa0K.\\xa0Loucks.

              "'“Of such great powers or beings there may be conceivably a survival\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\na survival of a hugely remote period when\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. consciousness was manifested,\\nperhaps, in shapes and forms long since withdrawn before the tide of advancing humanity\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\nforms of which poetry and legend alone have caught a flying memory and called them gods, monsters,\\nmythical beings of all sorts and kinds.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.”\\n—Algernon Blackwood.\\nI.The Horror in Clay.\\n\\nThe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate\\nall its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity,\\nand it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction,\\nhave hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will\\nopen up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall\\neither go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of\\na new dark age.\\nTheosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein\\nour world and human race form transient incidents. They have hinted at strange survivals in\\nterms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism. But it is not from them\\nthat there came the single glimpse of forbidden aeons which chills me when I think of it and\\nmaddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse, like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed out from\\nan accidental piecing together of separated things—in this case an old newspaper item\\nand the notes of a dead professor. I hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out;\\ncertainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain. I think that\\nthe professor, too, intended to keep silent regarding the part he knew, and that he would have\\ndestroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him.\\nMy knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926–27 with the death\\nof my grand-uncle George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brown University,\\nProvidence, Rhode Island. Professor Angell was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions,\\nand had frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums; so that his passing at\\nthe age of ninety-two may be recalled by many. Locally, interest was intensified by the obscurity\\nof the cause of death. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the Newport boat;\\nfalling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical-looking negro who\\nhad come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short\\ncut from the waterfront to the deceased’s home in Williams Street. Physicians were unable\\nto find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion\\nof the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible\\nfor the end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but latterly I am inclined\\nto wonder—and more than wonder.\\nAs my grand-uncle’s heir and executor, for he died a childless widower,\\nI was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purpose moved his\\nentire set of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of the material which I correlated\\nwill be later published by the American Archaeological Society, but there was one box which\\nI found exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much averse from shewing to other eyes. It had\\nbeen locked, and I did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal ring\\nwhich the professor carried always in his pocket. Then indeed I succeeded in opening it, but\\nwhen I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more closely locked barrier. For\\nwhat could be the meaning of the queer clay bas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings,\\nand cuttings which I found? Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the most\\nsuperficial impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this\\napparent disturbance of an old man’s peace of mind.\\nThe bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five\\nby six inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs, however, were far from modern\\nin atmosphere and suggestion; for although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and\\nwild, they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing.\\nAnd writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be; though my memory,\\ndespite much familiarity with the papers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify\\nthis particular species, or even to hint at its remotest affiliations.\\nAbove these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial intent,\\nthough its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. It seemed to be\\na sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could\\nconceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of\\nan octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the\\nthing. A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings;\\nbut it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful.\\nBehind the figure was a vague suggestion of a Cyclopean architectural background.\\nThe writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of press cuttings,\\nin Professor Angell’s most recent hand; and made no pretence to literary style. What seemed\\nto be the main document was headed “CTHULHU CULT” in characters painstakingly printed\\nto avoid the erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of. The manuscript was divided into two\\nsections, the first of which was headed “1925—Dream and Dream Work of H. A. Wilcox,\\n7 Thomas St., Providence, R.I.”, and the second, “Narrative of Inspector John R.\\nLegrasse, 121 Bienville St., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg.—Notes on Same, &\\nProf. Webb’s Acct.” The other manuscript papers were all brief notes, some of them\\naccounts of the queer dreams of different persons, some of them citations from theosophical\\nbooks and magazines (notably W. Scott-Elliot’s Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria),\\nand the rest comments on long-surviving secret societies and hidden cults, with references to\\npassages in such mythological and anthropological source-books as Frazer’s Golden Bough\\nand Miss Murray’s Witch-Cult in Western Europe. The cuttings largely alluded to\\noutré mental illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925.\\nThe first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale. It appears\\nthat on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon\\nProfessor Angell bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and fresh.\\nHis card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle had recognised him as the youngest\\nson of an excellent family slightly known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at\\nthe Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near that institution.\\nWilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity, and had from childhood\\nexcited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating.\\nHe called himself “psychically hypersensitive”, but the staid folk of the ancient\\ncommercial city dismissed him as merely “queer”. Never mingling much with his kind,\\nhe had dropped gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a small group of\\naesthetes from other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its conservatism,\\nhad found him quite hopeless.\\nOn the occasion of the visit, ran the professor’s manuscript, the sculptor\\nabruptly asked for the benefit of his host’s archaeological knowledge in identifying the\\nhieroglyphics on the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and\\nalienated sympathy; and my uncle shewed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness\\nof the tablet implied kinship with anything but archaeology. Young Wilcox’s rejoinder,\\nwhich impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically\\npoetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since found highly\\ncharacteristic of him. He said, “It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream\\nof strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or\\ngarden-girdled Babylon.”\\nIt was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping\\nmemory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a slight earthquake tremor the\\nnight before, the most considerable felt in New England for some years; and Wilcox’s imagination\\nhad been keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean\\ncities of titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with\\nlatent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point\\nbelow had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute\\ninto sound, but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters,\\n“Cthulhu fhtagn”.\\nThis verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed\\nProfessor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; and studied with almost\\nfrantic intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad\\nonly in his night-clothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his\\nold age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness in recognising both hieroglyphics and pictorial\\ndesign. Many of his questions seemed highly out-of-place to his visitor, especially those which\\ntried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand\\nthe repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership\\nin some widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor Angell became convinced\\nthat the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his\\nvisitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for after the first\\ninterview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man, during which he related startling\\nfragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark\\nand dripping stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical\\nsense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds most frequently repeated are those\\nrendered by the letters “Cthulhu” and “R’lyeh”.\\nOn March 23d, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiries\\nat his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to\\nthe home of his family in Waterman Street. He had cried out in the night, arousing several other\\nartists in the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness\\nand delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close\\nwatch of the case; calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to\\nbe in charge. The youth’s febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things; and\\nthe doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them. They included not only a repetition of\\nwhat he had formerly dreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing “miles high”\\nwhich walked or lumbered about. He at no time fully described this object, but occasional frantic\\nwords, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the professor that it must be identical with the\\nnameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this object,\\nthe doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man’s subsidence into lethargy.\\nHis temperature, oddly enough, was not greatly above normal; but his whole condition was otherwise\\nsuch as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder.\\nOn April 2nd at about 3 p.m. every trace of Wilcox’s malady suddenly\\nceased. He sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of\\nwhat had happened in dream or reality since the night of March 22nd. Pronounced well by his\\nphysician, he returned to his quarters in three days; but to Professor Angell he was of no further\\nassistance. All traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept\\nno record of his night-thoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly\\nusual visions.\\nHere the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain of the\\nscattered notes gave me much material for thought—so much, in fact, that only the ingrained\\nscepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the artist. The\\nnotes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same\\nperiod as that in which young Wilcox had had his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had\\nquickly instituted a prodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends\\nwhom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and\\nthe dates of any notable visions for some time past. The reception of his request seems to have\\nbeen varied; but he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any ordinary\\nman could have handled without a secretary. This original correspondence was not preserved,\\nbut his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest. Average people in society and\\nbusiness—New England’s traditional “salt of the earth”—gave an\\nalmost completely negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions\\nappear here and there, always between March 23d and April 2nd—the period of young Wilcox’s\\ndelirium. Scientific men were little more affected, though four cases of vague description suggest\\nfugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something\\nabnormal.\\nIt was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I know\\nthat panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes. As it was, lacking their\\noriginal letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having\\nedited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see. That is\\nwhy I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed,\\nhad been imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from aesthetes told a disturbing\\ntale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things,\\nthe intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor’s\\ndelirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported scenes and half-sounds not\\nunlike those which Wilcox had described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the\\ngigantic nameless thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with emphasis,\\nwas very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism,\\nwent violently insane on the date of young Wilcox’s seizure, and expired several months\\nlater after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle\\nreferred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration\\nand personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these,\\nhowever, bore out the notes in full. I have often wondered if all the objects of the professor’s\\nquestioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever\\nreach them.\\nThe press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania,\\nand eccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell must have employed a cutting bureau,\\nfor the number of extracts was tremendous and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here\\nwas a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking\\ncry. Here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic\\ndeduces a dire future from visions he has seen. A despatch from California describes a theosophist\\ncolony as donning white robes en masse for some “glorious fulfilment” which never\\narrives, whilst items from India speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of\\nMarch. Voodoo orgies multiply in Hayti, and African outposts report ominous mutterings. American\\nofficers in the Philippines find certain tribes bothersome about this time, and New York policemen\\nare mobbed by hysterical Levantines on the night of March 22–23. The west of Ireland,\\ntoo, is full of wild rumour and legendry, and a fantastic painter named Ardois-Bonnot hangs\\na blasphemous “Dream Landscape” in the Paris spring salon of 1926. And so numerous\\nare the recorded troubles in insane asylums, that only a miracle can have stopped the medical\\nfraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions. A weird bunch\\nof cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with\\nwhich I set them aside. But I was then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters\\nmentioned by the professor.\\nII.The Tale of Inspector Legrasse.\\n\\nThe older matters which had made the sculptor’s dream and bas-relief so significant to\\nmy uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript. Once before, it appears,\\nProfessor Angell had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the\\nunknown hieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as “Cthulhu”;\\nand all this in so stirring and horrible a connexion that it is small wonder he pursued young\\nWilcox with queries and demands for data.\\nThe earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when the American\\nArchaeological Society held its annual meeting in St. Louis. Professor Angell, as befitted one\\nof his authority and attainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was\\none of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation\\nto offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solution.\\nThe chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for\\nthe entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had travelled all the way\\nfrom New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source. His name\\nwas John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an Inspector of Police. With him he bore\\nthe subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette\\nwhose origin he was at a loss to determine. It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had\\nthe least interest in archaeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted\\nby purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, or whatever it was, had\\nbeen captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on\\na supposed voodoo meeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it, that\\nthe police could not but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them,\\nand infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of its origin,\\napart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members, absolutely\\nnothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which\\nmight help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain-head.\\nInspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering\\ncreated. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a\\nstate of tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive\\nfigure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at\\nunopened and archaic vistas. No recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object,\\nyet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of\\nunplaceable stone.\\nThe figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful\\nstudy, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship.\\nIt represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose\\nface was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore\\nfeet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural\\nmalignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block\\nor pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings touched the back edge\\nof the block, the seat occupied the centre, whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up,\\ncrouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the\\nbottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facial\\nfeelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher’s elevated knees.\\nThe aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, and the more subtly fearful because its source\\nwas so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was unmistakable; yet not one\\nlink did it shew with any known type of art belonging to civilisation’s youth—or\\nindeed to any other time. Totally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the\\nsoapy, greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing\\nfamiliar to geology or mineralogy. The characters along the base were equally baffling; and\\nno member present, despite a representation of half the world’s expert learning in this\\nfield, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship. They, like the\\nsubject and material, belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we\\nknow it; something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our\\nworld and our conceptions have no part.\\nAnd yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at\\nthe Inspector’s problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of\\nbizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence\\nof the odd trifle he knew. This person was the late William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology\\nin Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note. Professor Webb had been engaged,\\nforty-eight years before, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions\\nwhich he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast had encountered a\\nsingular tribe or cult of degenerate Esquimaux whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship,\\nchilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which\\nother Esquimaux knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had\\ncome down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made. Besides nameless rites\\nand human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder\\ndevil or tornasuk; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from\\nan aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew\\nhow. But just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around\\nwhich they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the professor stated,\\na very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing. And\\nso far as he could tell, it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing\\nnow lying before the meeting.\\nThis data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members,\\nproved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at once to ply his informant with\\nquestions. Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp cult-worshippers his men had\\narrested, he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst\\nthe diabolist Esquimaux. There then followed an exhaustive comparison of details, and a moment\\nof really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the\\nphrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart. What, in substance, both\\nthe Esquimau wizards and the Louisiana swamp-priests had chanted to their kindred idols was\\nsomething very like this—the word-divisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in\\nthe phrase as chanted aloud:\\n“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl\\nfhtagn.”\\nLegrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among his\\nmongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant. This\\ntext, as given, ran something like this:\\n“In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.”\\nAnd now, in response to a general and urgent demand, Inspector Legrasse related\\nas fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshippers; telling a story to which I could\\nsee my uncle attached profound significance. It savoured of the wildest dreams of myth-maker\\nand theosophist, and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such half-castes\\nand pariahs as might be least expected to possess it.\\nOn November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a frantic summons\\nfrom the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters there, mostly primitive but good-natured\\ndescendants of Lafitte’s men, were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which\\nhad stolen upon them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible\\nsort than they had ever known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the\\nmalevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where\\nno dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling chants and\\ndancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added, the people could stand it no more.\\nSo a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set\\nout in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of the passable\\nroad they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods\\nwhere day never came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and\\nnow and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of\\nmorbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to\\ncreate. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight; and hysterical\\ndwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms\\nwas now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when\\nthe wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through the pale undergrowth beyond\\nendless avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the cowed\\nsquatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship, so\\nInspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror\\nthat none of them had ever trod before.\\nThe region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute,\\nsubstantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed\\nby mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and\\nsquatters whispered that bat-winged devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship\\nit at midnight. They said it had been there before D’Iberville, before La Salle, before\\nthe Indians, and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself,\\nand to see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to keep away. The present\\nvoodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location was bad\\nenough; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the\\nshocking sounds and incidents.\\nOnly poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasse’s\\nmen as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and the muffled tom-toms.\\nThere are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is\\nterrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other. Animal fury and orgiastic licence\\nhere whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and\\nreverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell.\\nNow and then the less organised ululation would cease, and from what seemed a well-drilled chorus\\nof hoarse voices would rise in sing-song chant that hideous phrase or ritual:\\n“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl\\nfhtagn.”\\n\\nThen the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came suddenly in sight of\\nthe spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two were shaken into a frantic cry\\nwhich the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the\\nface of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotised with horror.\\nIn a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre’s\\nextent, clear of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable\\nhorde of human abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarola could paint. Void of clothing,\\nthis hybrid spawn were braying, bellowing, and writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped bonfire;\\nin the centre of which, revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame, stood a great\\ngranite monolith some eight feet in height; on top of which, incongruous with its diminutiveness,\\nrested the noxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular intervals\\nwith the flame-girt monolith as a centre hung, head downward, the oddly marred bodies of the\\nhelpless squatters who had disappeared. It was inside this circle that the ring of worshippers\\njumped and roared, the general direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless\\nBacchanal between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire.\\nIt may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced\\none of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual\\nfrom some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror. This\\nman, Joseph D. Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly imaginative.\\nHe indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining\\neyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees—but I suppose he had been\\nhearing too much native superstition.\\nActually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration.\\nDuty came first; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the\\nthrong, the police relied on their firearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout.\\nFor five minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description. Wild blows were struck,\\nshots were fired, and escapes were made; but in the end Legrasse was able to count some forty-seven\\nsullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows of policemen.\\nFive of the worshippers lay dead, and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised\\nstretchers by their fellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully removed\\nand carried back by Legrasse.\\nExamined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness, the\\nprisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and mentally aberrant type. Most\\nwere seamen, and a sprinkling of negroes and mulattoes, largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese\\nfrom the Cape Verde Islands, gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult. But before\\nmany questions were asked, it became manifest that something far deeper and older than negro\\nfetichism was involved. Degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprising\\nconsistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith.\\nThey worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there\\nwere any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now,\\ninside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to\\nthe first men, who formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the prisoners\\nsaid it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places\\nall over the world until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the\\nmighty city of R’lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath\\nhis sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would always\\nbe waiting to liberate him.\\nMeanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture could\\nnot extract. Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth, for shapes\\ncame out of the dark to visit the faithful few. But these were not the Great Old Ones. No man\\nhad ever seen the Old Ones. The carven idol was great Cthulhu, but none might say whether or\\nnot the others were precisely like him. No one could read the old writing now, but things were\\ntold by word of mouth. The chanted ritual was not the secret—that was never spoken aloud,\\nonly whispered. The chant meant only this: “In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu\\nwaits dreaming.”\\nOnly two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and the rest\\nwere committed to various institutions. All denied a part in the ritual murders, and averred\\nthat the killing had been done by Black Winged Ones which had come to them from their immemorial\\nmeeting-place in the haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no coherent account could\\never be gained. What the police did extract, came mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named\\nCastro, who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the cult\\nin the mountains of China.\\nOld Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of\\ntheosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. There had been aeons\\nwhen other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities. Remains of Them, he said\\nthe deathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in\\nthe Pacific. They all died vast epochs of time before men came, but there were arts which could\\nrevive Them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity.\\nThey had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought Their images with Them.\\nThese Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether of flesh\\nand blood. They had shape—for did not this star-fashioned image prove it?—but that\\nshape was not made of matter. When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world\\nthrough the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They no longer\\nlived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R’lyeh,\\npreserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the\\nearth might once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside must serve\\nto liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved Them intact likewise prevented Them from\\nmaking an initial move, and They could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted\\nmillions of years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe, but Their mode\\nof speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When, after infinities\\nof chaos, the first men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding\\ntheir dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of mammals.\\nThen, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult around small idols\\nwhich the Great Ones shewed them; idols brought in dim aeras from dark stars. That cult would\\nnever die till the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from\\nHis tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would be easy to know,\\nfor then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and\\nevil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy.\\nThen the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy\\nthemselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile\\nthe cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow\\nforth the prophecy of their return.\\nIn the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in dreams,\\nbut then something had happened. The great stone city R’lyeh, with its monoliths and sepulchres,\\nhad sunk beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full of the one primal mystery through which\\nnot even thought can pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse. But memory never died, and\\nhigh-priests said that the city would rise again when the stars were right. Then came out of\\nthe earth the black spirits of earth, mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours picked up\\nin caverns beneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speak much. He cut\\nhimself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction.\\nThe size of the Old Ones, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said\\nthat he thought the centre lay amid the pathless deserts of Arabia, where Irem, the City of\\nPillars, dreams hidden and untouched. It was not allied to the European witch-cult, and was\\nvirtually unknown beyond its members. No book had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless\\nChinamen said that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul\\nAlhazred which the initiated might read as they chose, especially the much-discussed couplet:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is not dead which can eternal lie,\\n            And with strange aeons even death may die.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLegrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired in vain\\nconcerning the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro, apparently, had told the truth when\\nhe said that it was wholly secret. The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light\\nupon either cult or image, and now the detective had come to the highest authorities in the\\ncountry and met with no more than the Greenland tale of Professor Webb.\\nThe feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasse’s tale, corroborated\\nas it was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who attended;\\nalthough scant mention occurs in the formal publications of the society. Caution is the first\\ncare of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture. Legrasse for some time\\nlent the image to Professor Webb, but at the latter’s death it was returned to him and\\nremains in his possession, where I viewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and\\nunmistakably akin to the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.\\nThat my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for\\nwhat thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Legrasse had learned of the\\ncult, of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics\\nof the swamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come in his dreams upon\\nat least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by Esquimau diabolists and\\nmongrel Louisianans? Professor Angell’s instant start on an investigation of the utmost\\nthoroughness was eminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having heard\\nof the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and\\ncontinue the mystery at my uncle’s expense. The dream-narratives and cuttings collected\\nby the professor were, of course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the\\nextravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions.\\nSo, after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological\\nnotes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor and\\ngive him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man.\\nWilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas Street, a hideous\\nVictorian imitation of seventeenth-century Breton architecture which flaunts its stuccoed front\\namidst the lovely colonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the very shadow of the finest\\nGeorgian steeple in America. I found him at work in his rooms, and at once conceded from the\\nspecimens scattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic. He will, I believe,\\nsome time be heard from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallised in clay and will\\none day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which Arthur Machen evokes in prose,\\nand Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in verse and in painting.\\nDark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock\\nand asked me my business without rising. When I told him who I was, he displayed some interest;\\nfor my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams, yet had never explained\\nthe reason for the study. I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought with some\\nsubtlety to draw him out. In a short time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity, for\\nhe spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their subconscious residuum\\nhad influenced his art profoundly, and he shewed me a morbid statue whose contours almost made\\nme shake with the potency of its black suggestion. He could not recall having seen the original\\nof this thing except in his own dream bas-relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly\\nunder his hands. It was, no doubt, the giant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he really\\nknew nothing of the hidden cult, save from what my uncle’s relentless catechism had let\\nfall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which he could possibly\\nhave received the weird impressions.\\nHe talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see with terrible\\nvividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone—whose geometry, he oddly\\nsaid, was all wrong—and hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless, half-mental\\ncalling from underground: “Cthulhu fhtagn”, “Cthulhu fhtagn”.\\nThese words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhu’s dream-vigil\\nin his stone vault at R’lyeh, and I felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs. Wilcox,\\nI was sure, had heard of the cult in some casual way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass\\nof his equally weird reading and imagining. Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, it\\nhad found subconscious expression in dreams, in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I\\nnow beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one. The youth was\\nof a type, at once slightly affected and slightly ill-mannered, which I could never like; but\\nI was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty. I took leave of him amicably,\\nand wish him all the success his talent promises.\\nThe matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times I had visions\\nof personal fame from researches into its origin and connexions. I visited New Orleans, talked\\nwith Legrasse and others of that old-time raiding-party, saw the frightful image, and even questioned\\nsuch of the mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Castro, unfortunately, had been dead for\\nsome years. What I now heard so graphically at first-hand, though it was really no more than\\na detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I felt sure that\\nI was on the track of a very real, very secret, and very ancient religion whose discovery would\\nmake me an anthropologist of note. My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, as\\nI wish it still were, and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence\\nof the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by Professor Angell.\\nOne thing I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my\\nuncle’s death was far from natural. He fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an\\nancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from a negro sailor.\\nI did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cult-members in Louisiana, and would\\nnot be surprised to learn of secret methods and poison needles as ruthless and as anciently\\nknown as the cryptic rites and beliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone;\\nbut in Norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper inquiries of my\\nuncle after encountering the sculptor’s data have come to sinister ears? I think Professor\\nAngell died because he knew too much, or because he was likely to learn too much. Whether I\\nshall go as he did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now.\\nIII.The Madness from the Sea.\\n\\nIf heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere\\nchance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on which I\\nwould naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of an\\nAustralian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting\\nbureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle’s\\nresearch.\\nI had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the\\n“Cthulhu Cult”, and was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, New Jersey; the curator\\nof a local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one day the reserve specimens roughly\\nset on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture\\nin one of the old papers spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have\\nmentioned, for my friend has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture\\nwas a half-tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found\\nin the swamp.\\nEagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in\\ndetail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What it suggested, however,\\nwas of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate\\naction. It read as follows:\\nMYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA\\nVigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow.\\nOne Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of\\nDesperate Battle and Deaths at Sea.\\nRescued Seaman Refuses\\nParticulars of Strange Experience.\\nOdd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry\\nto Follow.\\n\\nThe Morrison Co.’s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this morning\\nat its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam\\nyacht Alert of Dunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34° 21′,\\nW. Longitude 152° 17′ with one living and one dead man aboard.\\nThe Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2nd was driven\\nconsiderably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves. On April 12th\\nthe derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain\\none survivor in a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more\\nthan a week. The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about a foot\\nin height, regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and the\\nMuseum in College Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says he found\\nin the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern.\\nThis man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of\\npiracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been\\nsecond mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February\\n20th with a complement of eleven men. The Emma, he says, was delayed and thrown widely\\nsouth of her course by the great storm of March 1st, and on March 22nd, in S. Latitude 49°\\n51′, W. Longitude 128° 34′, encountered the Alert, manned by a queer and evil-looking\\ncrew of Kanakas and half-castes. Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused;\\nwhereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner with\\na peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yacht’s equipment. The\\nEmma’s men shewed fight, says the survivor, and though the schooner began to sink\\nfrom shots beneath the waterline they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board her,\\ngrappling with the savage crew on the yacht’s deck, and being forced to kill them all,\\nthe number being slightly superior, because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though\\nrather clumsy mode of fighting.\\nThree of the Emma’s men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate\\nGreen, were killed; and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to navigate\\nthe captured yacht, going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering\\nback had existed. The next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although\\nnone is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though\\nJohansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling\\ninto a rock chasm. Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage\\nher, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd. From that time till his rescue on the\\n12th the man remembers little, and he does not even recall when William Briden, his companion,\\ndied. Briden’s death reveals no apparent cause, and was probably due to excitement or\\nexposure. Cable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an\\nisland trader, and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront. It was owned by a curious group\\nof half-castes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity;\\nand it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors of March 1st. Our\\nAuckland correspondent gives the Emma and her crew an excellent reputation, and Johansen\\nis described as a sober and worthy man. The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole\\nmatter beginning tomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce Johansen to speak more\\nfreely than he has done hitherto.\\nThis was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what a train\\nof ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence\\nthat it had strange interests at sea as well as on land. What motive prompted the hybrid crew\\nto order back the Emma as they sailed about with their hideous idol? What was the unknown\\nisland on which six of the Emma’s crew had died, and about which the mate Johansen\\nwas so secretive? What had the vice-admiralty’s investigation brought out, and what was\\nknown of the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvellous of all, what deep and more than natural\\nlinkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance to the various\\nturns of events so carefully noted by my uncle?\\nMarch 1st—our February 28th according to the International Date Line—the\\nearthquake and storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew had darted\\neagerly forth as if imperiously summoned, and on the other side of the earth poets and artists\\nhad begun to dream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had moulded in\\nhis sleep the form of the dreaded Cthulhu. March 23d the crew of the Emma landed on an\\nunknown island and left six men dead; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a\\nheightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster’s malign pursuit, whilst\\nan architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium! And what of this\\nstorm of April 2nd—the date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged\\nunharmed from the bondage of strange fever? What of all this—and of those hints of old\\nCastro about the sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign; their faithful cult and\\ntheir mastery of dreams? Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man’s\\npower to bear? If so, they must be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the second of\\nApril had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of mankind’s soul.\\nThat evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my host\\nadieu and took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month I was in Dunedin; where, however,\\nI found that little was known of the strange cult-members who had lingered in the old sea-taverns.\\nWaterfront scum was far too common for special mention; though there was vague talk about one\\ninland trip these mongrels had made, during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on\\nthe distant hills. In Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with yellow hair turned\\nwhite after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at Sydney, and had thereafter sold\\nhis cottage in West Street and sailed with his wife to his old home in Oslo. Of his stirring\\nexperience he would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty officials, and all\\nthey could do was to give me his Oslo address.\\nAfter that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members\\nof the vice-admiralty court. I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, at Circular\\nQuay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing from its non-committal bulk. The crouching image with\\nits cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal, was preserved in the\\nMuseum at Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well, finding it a thing of balefully exquisite\\nworkmanship, and with the same utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness\\nof material which I had noted in Legrasse’s smaller specimen. Geologists, the curator\\ntold me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed that the world held no rock like it.\\nThen I thought with a shudder of what old Castro had told Legrasse about the primal Great Ones:\\n“They had come from the stars, and had brought Their images with Them.”\\nShaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now resolved\\nto visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I reëmbarked at once for the Norwegian\\ncapital; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of the Egeberg. Johansen’s\\naddress, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the name\\nof Oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as “Christiana”.\\nI made the brief trip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and\\nancient building with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black answered my summons, and I\\nwas stung with disappointment when she told me in halting English that Gustaf Johansen was no\\nmore.\\nHe had not survived his return, said his wife, for the doings at sea in 1925\\nhad broken him. He had told her no more than he had told the public, but had left a long manuscript—of\\n“technical matters” as he said—written in English, evidently in order to safeguard\\nher from the peril of casual perusal. During a walk through a narrow lane near the Gothenburg\\ndock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic window had knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors\\nat once helped him to his feet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physicians\\nfound no adequate cause for the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitution.\\nI now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me\\ntill I, too, am at rest; “accidentally” or otherwise. Persuading the widow that\\nmy connexion with her husband’s “technical matters” was sufficient to entitle\\nme to his manuscript, I bore the document away and began to read it on the London boat. It was\\na simple, rambling thing—a naive sailor’s effort at a post-facto diary—and\\nstrove to recall day by day that last awful voyage. I cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim\\nin all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to shew why the sound\\nof the water against the vessel’s sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped my\\nears with cotton.\\nJohansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the city and\\nthe Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly\\nbehind life in time and in space, and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which\\ndream beneath the sea, known and favoured by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them\\non the world whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the\\nsun and air.\\nJohansen’s voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty.\\nThe Emma, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force\\nof that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that\\nfilled men’s dreams. Once more under control, the ship was making good progress when held\\nup by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate’s regret as he wrote of\\nher bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant\\nhorror. There was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction\\nseem almost a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought\\nagainst his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity\\nin their captured yacht under Johansen’s command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking\\nout of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47° 9′, W. Longitude 126° 43′ come upon a coast-line\\nof mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible\\nsubstance of earth’s supreme terror—the nightmare corpse-city of R’lyeh, that\\nwas built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down\\nfrom the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and\\nsending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams\\nof the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation\\nand restoration. All this Johansen did not suspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!\\nI suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned citadel\\nwhereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I think of the extent\\nof all that may be brooding down there I almost wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and\\nhis men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder daemons, and must\\nhave guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet. Awe at the\\nunbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith,\\nand at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the queer image\\nfound in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible in every line of the mate’s\\nfrightened description.\\nWithout knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close\\nto it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing any definite structure or building,\\nhe dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces—surfaces too great\\nto belong to any thing right or proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and\\nhieroglyphs. I mention his talk about angles because it suggests something Wilcox had\\ntold me of his awful dreams. He had said that the geometry of the dream-place he saw\\nwas abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours.\\nNow an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality.\\nJohansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous Acropolis,\\nand clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase.\\nThe very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarising miasma welling out\\nfrom this sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily\\nelusive angles of carven rock where a second glance shewed concavity after the first shewed\\nconvexity.\\nSomething very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything\\nmore definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each would have fled had he not feared the\\nscorn of the others, and it was only half-heartedly that they searched—vainly, as it proved—for\\nsome portable souvenir to bear away.\\nIt was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and\\nshouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked curiously at the immense carved\\ndoor with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door;\\nand they all felt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around\\nit, though they could not decide whether it lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an outside\\ncellar-door. As Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not\\nbe sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative position of everything\\nelse seemed phantasmally variable.\\nBriden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then Donovan felt\\nover it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went. He climbed interminably\\nalong the grotesque stone moulding—that is, one would call it climbing if the thing was\\nnot after all horizontal—and the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so\\nvast. Then, very softly and slowly, the acre-great panel began to give inward at the top; and\\nthey saw that it was balanced. Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb\\nand rejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven\\nportal. In this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a diagonal way, so\\nthat all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upset.\\nThe aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness\\nwas indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought\\nto have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment,\\nvisibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous\\nwings. The odour arising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared\\nHawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone\\nwas listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous\\ngreen immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of\\nmadness.\\nPoor Johansen’s handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of\\nthe six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed\\ninstant. The Thing cannot be described—there is no language for such abysms of shrieking\\nand immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order.\\nA mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth a great architect went\\nmad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the\\ngreen, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and\\nwhat an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident.\\nAfter vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.\\nThree men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. God rest\\nthem, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan, Guerrera, and Ångstrom.\\nParker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green-crusted\\nrock to the boat, and Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn’t\\nhave been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Briden\\nand Johansen reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous\\nmonstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of the water.\\nSteam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all\\nhands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down\\nbetween wheel and engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors\\nof that indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of\\nthat charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered\\nlike Polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops,\\ngreat Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising strokes\\nof cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing\\nat intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.\\nBut Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely overtake\\nthe Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and, setting the\\nengine for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty\\neddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave\\nNorwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth\\nlike the stern of a daemon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came nearly up\\nto the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Johansen drove on relentlessly. There was a bursting\\nas of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of a thousand\\nopened graves, and a sound that the chronicler would not put on paper. For an instant the ship\\nwas befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then there was only a venomous seething\\nastern; where—God in heaven!—the scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn\\nwas nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened\\nevery second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam.\\nThat was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and\\nattended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side. He did not\\ntry to navigate after the first bold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his\\nsoul. Then came the storm of April 2nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness.\\nThere is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through\\nreeling universes on a comet’s tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon\\nand from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted,\\nhilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged mocking imps of Tartarus.\\nOut of that dream came rescue—the Vigilant, the vice-admiralty\\ncourt, the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the old house by the Egeberg.\\nHe could not tell—they would think him mad. He would write of what he knew before death\\ncame, but his wife must not guess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories.\\nThat was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside\\nthe bas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall go this record of mine—this\\ntest of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may never be pieced together\\nagain. I have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of\\nspring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my\\nlife will be long. As my uncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much,\\nand the cult still lives.\\nCthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has\\nshielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant\\nsailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance\\nand slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking\\nwhilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy.\\nWho knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness waits\\nand dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men. A time will come—but\\nI must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript, my executors\\nmay put caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReturn to “The Call of Cthulhu”\\nThis page last revised 20 August 2009.\\n\\n\\nURL:https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nContact Us\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSite Map\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSearch\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa01998–2024\\xa0by\\xa0Donovan\\xa0K.\\xa0Loucks.
